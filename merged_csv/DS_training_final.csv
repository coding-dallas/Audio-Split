/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_0.wav,32044,Hello friends! 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_1.wav,44556,I am Dr. Ritu Sharma. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_2.wav,82284,"I am faculty at National Law University, Delhi. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_3.wav,151724,"We are here as a part of MOOCs programme, you must have gone through the various modules "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_4.wav,71084,on MOOCs and other subjects. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_5.wav,168364,"Today also, we are going to talk about, as a part of MOOCs programme, we are going to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_6.wav,184044,"talk about reliability and validity, which is a very important concept of research methodology. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_7.wav,188844,You will be needing this concept again and again in all types of research that you carry out. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_8.wav,155564,"So, while understanding the concept of reliability and validity, we will be talking about the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_9.wav,86732,meaning and definitions of reliability and validity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_10.wav,187596,"We will also be discussing about the types of reliability, we will understand how to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_11.wav,112684,reach the reliability of qualitative datas. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_12.wav,153644,And then we will go onto the discussing the concept of validity and what relationship 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_13.wav,70732,does reliability has with validity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_14.wav,207116,"So, when we talk about the concept of reliability, in simple term, the concept of reliability "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_15.wav,205484,means the extent to which a measurement procedure gives the same results however and whenever 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_16.wav,45164,it is carried out. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_17.wav,143404,Validity is the con… extent to which it gives the correct results. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_18.wav,148524,"So there is a, they are very famous scholars named Kirk and Miller. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_19.wav,108204,They are given a beautiful example of physical world. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_20.wav,184076,"For example, a thermometer shows the same reading of eighty two degree celsius every "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_21.wav,104940,"time we plugged in, in a boiling water. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_22.wav,88396,It is obviously a reliable thermometer. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_23.wav,181164,But a thermometer that gives different reading near about hundred Celsius each time it is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_24.wav,182764,"placed in boiling water may not be reliable, but it is certainly quite valid. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_25.wav,213804,"So in other words, validity refers to the true or exact value of a finding. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_26.wav,254092,Any research that wants to be called as objective has to be both reliable as well as valid. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_27.wav,166476,"So according to Oxford Dictionary, when we talk about reliability, reliability is the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_28.wav,204172,"degree to which the results of a measurement, calculation or specification can be dependent "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_29.wav,119084,on the accurate on to be accurate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_30.wav,225964,"So, one can clearly say that reliability is about consistency, and a research would be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_31.wav,177356,"reliable if when repeated using the same method, it brings about the same results. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_32.wav,235212,"A researcher need to be, need to establish the usefulness of the data he or she gathered "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_33.wav,220844,to ensure that whe… whether the conclusion reached are representative enough to be applicable 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_34.wav,179884,to everyone and is it possible to repeat the research if others want to carry it out? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_35.wav,129676,"And if they do, will they get the similar results? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_36.wav,243852,So these questions can only be answered by researchers with the help of reliability and validity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_37.wav,209676,"So reliability of data becomes important because if we do not have reliable data, the conclusion "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_38.wav,114892,reached on their basis will be quite useless. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_39.wav,185324,"So, to have a better understanding of the concept of reliability, there are two things "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_40.wav,51244,which we need to understand. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_41.wav,107276,They are consistency and precisions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_42.wav,168652,"As it is important to obtain consistency, similar response to the same question in similar "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_43.wav,238764,circumstances and one has to know how systematic is the form of data that is based on asking 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_44.wav,134444,people questions about things that they know little about. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_45.wav,214124,"So, another typical feature which is very important with regard to reliability is repeatability. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_46.wav,206444,"That is, if anyone wants to carry out the same research as has been carried out by another "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_47.wav,161644,"researcher, would he get the same results as the result of the researcher who carried "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_48.wav,48716,out the research first? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_49.wav,182412,"If this happens, then the research of the first researcher would have repeatedly of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_50.wav,79116,the data collected method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_51.wav,214092,"So, there are four general estimators that researcher may encounter. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_52.wav,219564,"One, observer reliability, that is the degree to which different observer gives consistent answer. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_53.wav,206476,"Second, test-retest reliability, the consistency of a measure evaluated over time. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_54.wav,194924,"Third, parallel-form reliability, the the reliability of two tests constructed the same "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_55.wav,62764,way from the same content. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_56.wav,237132,"And finally, internal consistency reliability, the consistency of results across items, often "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_57.wav,189516,"measured with Cronbach’s Alpha, a statistical tool used as an estimate of the reliability "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_58.wav,56044,of a psychometric test. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_59.wav,178924,"So we will talk about the types of reliability, Kirk and Miller have discussed three types "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_60.wav,167372,of reliability which will help a researcher to understand how reliable is his data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_61.wav,203596,"So they are as follows- One, quixotic reliability, this refers to the circumstances in which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_62.wav,194924,a single method of observation yields the same measurement over and over again. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_63.wav,254732,"In other words, when a researcher ask questions, respondents respondents tend to give politically correct answers. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_64.wav,202316,"For example, if the subjects are asked questions like if they believe in giving equal rights "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_65.wav,218892,"to their daughters in property, most of the respondents give response in affirmation but "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_66.wav,68236,the reality is something else. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_67.wav,222732,This is called that the findings have only quixotic reliability because people tend to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_68.wav,101196,give those answers that they think are correct. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_69.wav,219564,"To get a correct view, one can ask the respondent if he would mind sharing his property with "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_70.wav,217964,his sister or do you mind if your wife give away her rights in her parent’s property? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_71.wav,124492,Such questions can give a better and a clear picture. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_72.wav,134476,The second type of reliability is diachronic reliability. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_73.wav,142732,This refers to the stability of an observation over time. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_74.wav,213804,"Some examples include the test-retest paradigm of experimental psychology and survey research, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_75.wav,221836,in which survey are conducted afresh after a gap of time to see if the results are the same. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_76.wav,126092,"And then, the third part is called a synchronic reliability. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_77.wav,216716,"This refers to the similarities of observation withi… within the same time period, which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_78.wav,171532,can be evaluated by comparison of the same data by different methods. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_79.wav,247756,"Unlike quixotic reliability, synchronic reliability involves observation that are consistent in nature. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_80.wav,246764,"In the words of Kirk and Miller, synchronic reliability is often more useful if it is absent. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_81.wav,200044,"In other words, if different methods or approaches to a problem throw up different results, it "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_82.wav,233324,"may caution the researcher to consider the other aspects of research, which he she has ignored earlier. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_83.wav,184044,A researcher should try to work towards increasing the reliability of data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_84.wav,165452,He can achieve this by documenting his field notes so that they can be compared with the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_85.wav,95436,other field researcher and other colleagues. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_86.wav,223372,"Berman recommends extensive, explicit and perceptive field notes, self-analytical repo… "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_87.wav,176364,"reporting of research procedure, and research context, documentation of the ethnographer’s "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_88.wav,90316,theories of society and his biases. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_89.wav,234892,"To make your field notes accessible to others, certain guidelines must be followed that enables "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_90.wav,209676,others to separate the concept of the observed from those of the observer. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_91.wav,179244,"So, the other method of achieving reliability can be by training the researcher before he "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_92.wav,197772,or she enters the field and by checking his interview notes regularly and guiding him 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_93.wav,52876,or her accordingly. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_94.wav,169964,This should be done immediately after the first interview so that correct measures are 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_95.wav,45164,taken at the earliest. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_96.wav,230764,"Thus, we can say that reliability is achieved by presenting the data in such a way that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_97.wav,249644,"the results speak not only about the interpretation given by the researcher, but also the voice of the respondents. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_98.wav,235852,"Apart from the results, the procedure adopted by the researcher should also be taken into account. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_99.wav,85804,"Now, we have discussed about reliability. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_100.wav,167116,We come to the next topic which is very close to reliability is called validity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_101.wav,63724,What is this Validity? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_102.wav,185644,Validity refers to the accuracy of the data generated by the research instrument like 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_103.wav,170924,an interview schedule or questionnaire or some other means of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_104.wav,188204,Validity answers questions like whether the method adopted by the researcher affects the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_105.wav,179884,results of the factors that should have been considered but were ignored. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_106.wav,89324,These answers refer to the internal validity of a researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_107.wav,297964,"Validity of a research is also about answering the question, how valid is one’s conception of the situation? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_108.wav,93164,How generalised are one’s results? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_109.wav,215404,"So, answer of these que… answer to these questions refer to the external validity of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_110.wav,237804,"your research, which can be explained as the generalised from the, from a sample to a population. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_111.wav,166124,Establishing external validity for an instrument then follows directly from sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_112.wav,102476,There is also a face validity and the content validity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_113.wav,179532,Face validity means stati… statistical measure of validity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_114.wav,250604,"For example, type one error will will require rejection of the hypothesis when it is true "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_115.wav,168972,and type two error will require acceptance of the hypothesis when it is false. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_116.wav,95724,This the concept of hypothesis is linked here. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_117.wav,135724,"So, if you have to understand the concept of hypothesis, you can go back to my module "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_118.wav,91276,on hypothesis and discuss that validity part there. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_119.wav,260524,"So, content validity on the other hand refers to the appropriateness of the content of an instrument. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_120.wav,181164,"In other words, do the measure that is questions or observation logs, etcetera, accurately "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_121.wav,86124,assess what you want to know? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_122.wav,105964,This is particularly important with the achievement test. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_123.wav,230764,Consider that a test developer wants to maximise the validity of a unit test for seventh grade mathematics. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_124.wav,161964,This would involve taking representa… representative questions from each of the sections of the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_125.wav,138892,unit and evaluating them against the desired outcomes. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_126.wav,138636,"So, that will be called as content validity. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_127.wav,182444,"It is easy to achieve validity in research as one has to keep in mind the adequate sampling, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_128.wav,213804,precision of observation and the subtle changes in environment and people are observed carefully. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_129.wav,204844,One can say that the concept of validity refers to the next extent to which the data provide 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_130.wav,99244,a true measurement of social reality. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_131.wav,257612,Let us take an example from IGNOU material on research methodology of shortage of power supply. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_132.wav,148236,You may be quite sure of the statistics about power shortage week by week. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_133.wav,177004,You also have to be sure how valid or accurate a picture of power shortage in the whole town 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_134.wav,151404,"or the state is, your static… statistics presence. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_135.wav,189804,"If you were to compare your figure with those collected by government agencies, its figure "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_136.wav,168684,"may be re… reliable, but the government’s definition of power shortage may not be the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_137.wav,106572,same as is used in your research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_138.wav,224364,"So and if this is the case, then the two set of statistics are not valid for the purpose "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_139.wav,241676,"of comparison because the comparison is not between two things alike and therefore, research is not valid. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_140.wav,93164,How do we achieve validity in our research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_141.wav,133804,So this is the question that we have to answer. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_142.wav,163884,"To bring about validity in the research process, Wolcott has suggested some guidelines. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_143.wav,90604,"They are, one should refrain from talking. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_144.wav,141804,"When you are in the field, listen as much as possible. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_145.wav,217292,"Secondly, produce field notes that are exact as as much as possible. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_146.wav,171916,Begin to write early so that you will not forget the little details that separate good 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_147.wav,90924,research from the ordinary research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_148.wav,198124,Write in such a way that your research can see for themselves the points you are trying to bring out. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_149.wav,214124,"In other words, provide enough data to enable readers to draw out their own inferences and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_150.wav,74604,follow the ones you are making. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_151.wav,138892,Your report should be as complete as possible. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_152.wav,164556,See feedback on your findings and presentation from your colleagues. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_153.wav,173132,Your presentation should be characterised by a balance between the various aspects you 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_154.wav,212876,have studied rather than leaning too heavily on one or the other aspect. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_155.wav,113644,Your presentation should display accuracy in writing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_156.wav,182124,"To check the validity of your research, one of the method is field research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_157.wav,180204,"The very nature of field work is its flexibility and openness, which enables one to study the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_158.wav,86444,data in a variety of ways. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_159.wav,185292,"As in field situation, routine contact with people on day-to-day basis over an extended "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_160.wav,186316,period of time will help the researcher to test the emerging hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_161.wav,215372,This method is very sensitive to discrepancies between meaning presumed by investigations 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_162.wav,107596,and those understood by the target population. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_163.wav,159084,So one has to clearly define his or her concept. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_164.wav,157452,Defining the concept is also very important for the researcher as the field is better 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_165.wav,72044,known to respondent than to the researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_166.wav,150796,"In a controlled experiment, the situation is other way around. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_167.wav,111724,But here the researcher has to work according to the respondent’s will. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_168.wav,277772,If the researcher is sincere and devoted to his field work and is receptive of the inputs 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_169.wav,199756,"given by the respondents, then his or her research has greater chances of being valid. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_170.wav,234572,The validity can also be checked by taking respondents into the confidence and try try 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_171.wav,119404,to involve them into research by the method of discussion. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_172.wav,266956,The researcher can share his or her data with the respondents and while discussing can ensure 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_173.wav,227244,that there is no discrepancy in what the respondent said and what he or she has written. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_174.wav,216652,"This method of checking also has its own drawback, as sometimes respondents may deny of what "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_175.wav,175436,the researcher has written as they might feel that it shows them in bad light. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_176.wav,220204,Here the role of the researcher becomes important as he or she has to differ… differentiate 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_177.wav,186252,between the real responses and the released responses. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_178.wav,173804,"Lincoln and Guba in their book, Naturalistic Inquiry suggests that for checking the validity "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_179.wav,207436,"of any data, a researcher should adopt few techniques while collecting the data and interacting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_180.wav,40332,with the respondent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_181.wav,191756,"The researcher should spend more time in the field, which will help the researcher to understand "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_182.wav,84844,his field and respondents better. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_183.wav,169932,Spending more time in the field will also help in the accuracy of the data as the researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_184.wav,189516,will be having a clear picture of the field and it is less likely that the respondent 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_185.wav,100492,is able to deceive the researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_186.wav,196204,"Now, when we have discussed the concept of reliability and validity, let us also understand "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_187.wav,123884,try to understand the relationship these two concepts have. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_188.wav,209964,So reliability and validity are two different concepts that may or may not be related to one another. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_189.wav,122604,"Mostly, if data are valid, they must be reliable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_190.wav,182476,"If people rec… receive very different scores on a test every time they take it, the test "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_191.wav,86732,is not likely to be to predict anything. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_192.wav,152684,"However, a test can be considered reliable but not valid. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_193.wav,235884,"For example, AILET or CLAT score can be used as a prediction of success in college. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_194.wav,249644,"It may be considered a reliable test, but only a moderately valid indicator of success. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_195.wav,211916,"Taking the same example of CLAT or AILET scores can, we can say that validity is more important "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_196.wav,233964,"than reliability, as in college admission, AILET or CLAT score may be a reliable test, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_197.wav,257644,"but not necessarily valid measure of other qualitative qualities college seeks, for example, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_198.wav,135724,leadership participation in various academic and cultural activities. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_199.wav,161004,"So, we can say this is reliable but not a valid measurement. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_200.wav,216364,The combination of the these aspects alongside the AILET or CLAT score is more valid measure 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_201.wav,258604,"of the applicant’s potential of, for graduation, later social involvement, and professional development. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_202.wav,168044,Last and the most important is the data should be both reliable as well as valid. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_203.wav,214444,Proponent of AILET and CLAT argue that it is both a reliable as well as valid test as 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_204.wav,243884,"it measures student’s knowledge and aptitude, mathematics, language and reasoning. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_205.wav,176684,"So to understand the relationship between reliability and validity, we can conceptualise "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_206.wav,299244,"them under four heads, that is Reliability and Validity, when the data is consistent "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_207.wav,174444,"and also measures what it meant to measure, that is, a stable construct. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_208.wav,127084,"In that case, a data will be reliable as well as valid. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_209.wav,139564,"In the second condition, when the data is reliable that is, there is a consistency in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_210.wav,72044,the data but not valid. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_211.wav,233004,"That means, it measures something consistently but it does not measure what it is meant to measure. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_212.wav,239084,"Third, the data is unreliable, that it is not consistent, but and not valid. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_213.wav,194924,That is it is inconsistent measures which does not measure what it meant to measure. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_214.wav,261804,"Finally, data is unreliable that is it is not consistent and valid that it measures "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_215.wav,56364,what it means to measure. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_216.wav,238124,"So, here unreliable data but it is measuring what it means to measure, that is, an unstable construct. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_217.wav,205484,A very important aspect with reliability and validity is how to measure the two. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_218.wav,197804,"So, while measuring reliability there are few methods that we have to keep in mind. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_219.wav,129004,One of them is stability or test-retest method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_220.wav,183084,"That means, it gives the same assessment twice separated by days, weeks or months. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_221.wav,214764,Reliability is stated as the correlation between scores at time one and time two. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_222.wav,94764,And this is how we can measure the reliability. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_223.wav,146284,The other way of measuring reliability is alternate form. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_224.wav,152364,It creates two forms of the same tests that vary the items slightly. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_225.wav,236524,Reliability is stated as correlation between score of test one and test two. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_226.wav,139564,The last way of measuring reliability is the internal consistency method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_227.wav,109484,This is also known as Alpha method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_228.wav,186284,It compares one half of the test to the other half or use methods such as Kuder-Richardson 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_229.wav,167724,"Formula twenty, that is KR twenty or Cronbach’s Alpha. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_230.wav,150764,The value for reliability coefficient range from zero to one. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_231.wav,166444,A coefficient of zero means no reliability and one means perfect reliability. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_232.wav,189164,"Since all tests have some error, reliability coefficient never reaches one. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_233.wav,153964,"Generally, if the reliability of a standardised test is above point zero eight, it is said "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_234.wav,97324,to have very good reliability. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_235.wav,165804,"If it is below point five zero, it would not be considered a reliable test. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_236.wav,208364,"As we have measured reliability, there is a method of measuring validity as well. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_237.wav,274924,Validity refers to the accuracy of an assessment whether or not it measures what it is supposed to measure. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_238.wav,150124,"Even if a test is reliable, it may not provide a valid measure. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_239.wav,198444,Let us imagine a bathroom scale that consistently tells you that you weigh one thirty pounds. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_240.wav,181164,"Reliability of the scale is very good, but it is not accurate because you actually weigh "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_241.wav,175084,one forty five pound and you reset the scale in a weak moment. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_242.wav,189164,"Some teachers, parents and school districts make decision about students based on assessments "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_243.wav,98604,"such as grades, promotion and graduation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_244.wav,209644,"The validity inferred from the assessment is essential, even more crucial than the reliability. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_245.wav,149804,"Also, if a test is valid, it is almost always reliable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_246.wav,183404,There are three ways in which validity can be measured in order to have confidence that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_247.wav,186924,a test is valid and therefore the inference we make based on the test scores are valid. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_248.wav,106924,All three kinds of validity evidence should be considered. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_249.wav,84204,To measure a content validity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_250.wav,46444,What is the content validity? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_251.wav,208684,The extent to which the content of the test matches the instructional objective. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_252.wav,172844,Example for this would be a semester or a quarter exam that only includes content converted 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_253.wav,190764,during the last six weeks is not a valid measure of the course’s overall objective. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_254.wav,115244,It has a very low content validity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_255.wav,147564," Criteria validity, it means the extent to which scores on the test are in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_256.wav,227244,"agreement with concurrent validity or predict that is, predictive validity and external criteria . "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_257.wav,163564,If the end of the year math test in fourth grade correlate highly with the statewide 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_258.wav,120364,"math test, they would have high concurrent validity. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_259.wav,205804,Construct validity is the extent to which an assessment correspond to other variables 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_260.wav,120364,as predicted by some rational or theory. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_261.wav,193644,If you can correctly hypothesize and ESOL students will perform differently on a reading 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_262.wav,232684,"test than English speaking student, because of theory, the assessment may have construct validity. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_263.wav,181484,This is how you can measure the validity and reliability of any test. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_264.wav,131564,Reliability and Validity are two important concepts for any research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_265.wav,159084,And it is important for the researcher to understand the relationship as well as the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_266.wav,63084,distinction between the two. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_267.wav,224364,It helps a researcher to have a better understanding of his or her results and make his or her 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_268.wav,45164,research more authentic. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_269.wav,98604,Reliability and validity are independent of each other. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_270.wav,208684,"A measurement may be valid, but not reliable or reliable, but not valid. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_271.wav,181804,"So, both qualitative as quantitative research requires reliability and validity. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_272.wav,276524,"Thus a researcher should keep in mind that for a research data to be use and value, it "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_273.wav,120044,should be both reliable as well as valid. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_274.wav,175724,So this gives us a concluding remark on reliability and validity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_24_Reliability_275.wav,172844,Hope this discussion is useful for you in conducting your research.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_177.wav,181196,The researcher should able to justify the methodology and should try to give reasoning 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_178.wav,92172,for the errors that have occurred in the experiment. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_179.wav,98604,Shuttleworth explains this with a beautiful example. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_180.wav,243916,He says that while drawing conclusion the researcher may think that another variable 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_181.wav,197452,influence the results and this variable was not eliminated during the experiment process. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_182.wav,202924,"A refined version of the experiment may help to achieve better results, if the new effect "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_184.wav,195212,"So, giving example of global warming he says that, “in the global warming example the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_185.wav,261196,"researcher might establish that, Carbon Dioxide   emission alone cannot be responsible for global warming. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_186.wav,311724,"They may decide that another effect is contributing, so purpose is that methane may also be a factor in global warming. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_187.wav,91564,A new study would incorporate methane into the model.” 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_188.wav,292204,This argument also supports our previous point that deals with the new aspects for the future research.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_189.wav,150124,"Then, a conclusion should also talk about the benefits of the research. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_192.wav,170284,"In explaining this point, Shuttleworth gives an example from the medicine and psychology "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_193.wav,232972,"field and says that, “in medicine and psychology the result may throw out a new way of treating "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_204.wav,111084,"So, the this is the most important part. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_205.wav,138924,"Then finally, when you are summarising in a conclusion. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_206.wav,99564,The strength of the result is summarising. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_207.wav,192044,The most important part about drawing conclusion is to check if the method and methodology

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_223.wav,209292,But remember that the reliability and validity need not be perfect to provide useful information. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_224.wav,200396,"So, while drawing conclusion a researcher must try to check all the following points. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_3.wav,61164,we can write a proposal now. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_4.wav,140204,And writing a proposal is a very important part and that’s the reason MOOCs has taken

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_10.wav,181164,"We’ll introduce the concept first that is, what is the role of the proposal within research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_11.wav,65292,We’ll understand the meaning of research proposal. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_12.wav,178956,"We will try to identify distinction between quantitative and qualitative proposal, then "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_13.wav,142124,we will examine if there is a formula for writing a successful research proposal. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_14.wav,145292,"Finally, we’ll provide a frame work structure for a research pro… proposal. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_15.wav,99564,"Now, why do we need a research proposal? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_16.wav,159116,"In order to address the major questions and issues of everyday social life, the researcher "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_17.wav,106284,may well need to conduct empirical work of some description. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_18.wav,148524,"However, such research pro… work is not an isolated activity. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_19.wav,160044,"It is a social activity that has potential repercussions for others, whether that be "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_32.wav,179564,All researchers should therefore be able to prepare a proposal for a research topic a professional standard. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_33.wav,157804,Being able to produce such a proposal is an important skill. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_34.wav,144044,Intending doctoral students are required to prepare such a proposal when applying for

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_44.wav,77484,"Now, what is a research proposal? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_45.wav,194604,The research proposal is an application that is prepared by a student or a university academician 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_46.wav,184044,or professional researcher for support prior to embarking upon a research study.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_49.wav,167404,implication of the proposed investigation as well as the timescales for completion. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_50.wav,91564,"At another level, however, the research proposal is an argument. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_51.wav,198124,"Through the document, you are presenting a case, in which the intention is to convince "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_52.wav,125804,others of the general merits and feasibility of the proposed study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_53.wav,218924,The research proposal should therefore aim to convey three key aspects of an intended research project. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_54.wav,95724,"First, its objective and scholarly significance. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_55.wav,58284,"Second, your technical qualifications. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_56.wav,105644,"Third, the level of funding required. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_57.wav,102764,"Now, how to draft a research proposal? "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_60.wav,186604,Whether one is intending to adopt a broadly qualitative research design or a strategy 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_61.wav,159724,that is largely quantitative in nature is likely to affect the shape and the format 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_62.wav,57004,of the research proposal. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_63.wav,190124,"Of course, those charged with the reviewing proposal would have very clear expectation "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_64.wav,220524,that certain content will be included in the proposal regardless of the intended research strategy. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_65.wav,160364,"However, some elements of a quantitative research proposal will not be included in a qualitative "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_66.wav,104044,research proposal and vice versa. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_67.wav,154604,"Furthermore, quantitative research proposals are likely to be more uniform than those designed "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_68.wav,102444,for broadly qualitative based studies. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_69.wav,158444,As Punch in his book on Introduction to Social Research- Qualitative and Qualitative Approaches 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_70.wav,188204,say that- It is easier in many respect to suggest proposal guidelines for a quantitative 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_71.wav,165804,"study, since there is a greater variety in qualitative studies and many qualitative studies "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_72.wav,102124,will be unfolding rather than pre-structured. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_73.wav,197164,An emerging study cannot be a specific in the proposal about its research question or 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_74.wav,57324,about details of the design. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_75.wav,125804,"When this is the case, the points need to be made in the proposal. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_79.wav,171564,"Now, let’s consider, ‘Is there a formula for writing successful research proposal?’ "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_80.wav,119724,"A research proposal, then is a written plan for a study. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_81.wav,132524,It spells out detail what the researcher intend to do. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_82.wav,208652,It permits others to learn about the intended research and to offer suggest for improving the study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_83.wav,174476,It helps the researcher to clarify what needs to be done and aims to avoid unintentional

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_85.wav,171564,"Module is intended to serve as a general framework, not a definite set of instructions. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_86.wav,201004,The only general rule that must always be adhered to is that the research proposal should 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_87.wav,76204,be both succinct and complete. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_88.wav,194284,Other than that each university research committee or external funding agency will have its own 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_89.wav,187244,"expectation about the actual format of the research proposal, and some will be more explicit "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_90.wav,62444,than the others in this respect. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_91.wav,164204,Research proposal often vary significantly in terms of length. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_92.wav,233644,In some cases application forms that prescribe precisely what is wanted and will need to be completed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_93.wav,191404,In other the researcher will have more latitude to decide upon the format of the project. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_94.wav,56300,"However, the onus will be on the researcher to bend to meet the requirement of the university "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_99.wav,106924,should make plentiful use of headings and bullet points.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_103.wav,122252,Let’s now sketch a outline of the proposed research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_104.wav,172876,"In the absence of any forms of guidelines, there are general themes that you might use "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_105.wav,136044,"to structure your own research proposal, whether this is a postgraduate dissertation or an "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_108.wav,52204,First one will the title page. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_109.wav,199724,"A title page should include each of the following, one, your name, the title of the proposed "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_112.wav,83852,Then you will be giving a abstract. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_113.wav,111436,Abstract is very important is very important because the abstract is the brief synopsis

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_128.wav,191116,There are usually four areas to be addressed in the section of the research proposal. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_129.wav,150796,"The purpose of the study, a justification for the project, the specific research question "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_130.wav,192012,"that you intend to explore, and a definition of any key terms and concept that you will examine. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_131.wav,100492,"However, you will write only one section. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_133.wav,155596,"Now, what is the purpose of the study that is also part of your project writing? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_134.wav,119404,You will need to state what the research purpose to investigate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_135.wav,207404,"The purpose should be concise statement, providing a framework to which details are laid. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_136.wav,170284,Generally speaking any study should seek to clarify some aspect of the field of the interest

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_140.wav,103724,That is the reason it it needs some kind of justification. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_141.wav,108524,You must present an argument for the work of the study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_142.wav,149804,This will usually form a substantial section of your research proposal and will require

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_148.wav,165804,Key questions to ask yourself at this point are- Have I identified the specific research

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_150.wav,129036,Have I indicated what intend to do about this problem?

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_178.wav,209292,to give them emphasis and to direct the reviewer’s attention to them. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_179.wav,41324,Aims of the research proposal. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_180.wav,70764,The aim is statement of intent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_181.wav,116204,It indicates the overall purpose and thrust of the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_182.wav,217036,It is also a statement of the main association and relationship that you seek to discover or establish.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_184.wav,194572,Setting yourself too many aims indicates that you are probably embarking on more than one project. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_185.wav,168076,Example might include- To determine whether or not lecturing is the most beneficial and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_186.wav,88364,preferred teaching strategy in the higher education. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_187.wav,217324,And to explore how health and safety legislation is applied in hospitals and to evaluate which

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_192.wav,232684,These aims will be answered by accumulating and integrating answers to a series of objectives that you set. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_193.wav,137324,"So, let’s understand the objectives of in a research proposal. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_194.wav,96044,The objectives are specific action statements. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_195.wav,160044,They can be perceived as stepping stones that eventually directs the study towards the more

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_197.wav,208044,They express in detail and in a more technical way than the aims. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_198.wav,76876,What is the research intended to achieve? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_199.wav,209612,"It may be it may be to explore, to identify, to describe, to explain, to understand, to "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_202.wav,194252,"So, a key question to ask yourself when drafting your objective is- Is it clear which data "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_203.wav,96684,are required to address in each objective? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_204.wav,171276,An example taken from Kumar’s book on Research Methodology- A step by step guide for beginners 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_205.wav,237452,provides objectives for the aim listed above concealing the study of alcoholism in the family. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_206.wav,211884,The project objectives are- To ascertain the impact of alcoholism on martial relationship. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_207.wav,212844,Then to determine the ways in which alcoholism affect the different aspects of children’s lives. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_208.wav,166124,And then to find out the effects of alcoholism on the financial situation of the family. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_209.wav,127436,"So, such objectives help to define the scope of the study. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_210.wav,183052,"As Kumar asserts, they should be worded in such a way that the wording clearly, completely "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_211.wav,95724,and specifically communicates your intentions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_212.wav,193356,"There is no place for ambiguity, non-specificity or incompleteness. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_215.wav,131532,Some key question you should ask yourself when you are for… for framing the objectives. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_216.wav,235564,Do the aims and the objectives adequately encapsulate the lull scope of the proposed project? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_217.wav,187276,Does or do the aims clearly indicate the overarching thrust of the intended study? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_218.wav,179884,Or the objectives sufficiently precise so that they indicate clearly what is to be done 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_219.wav,136044,in order to collect the data necessary to address the research aims? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_220.wav,150412,"Are the, are there logical connections between the aims and the objectives? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_221.wav,115916,Or do I have any hypothesis in mind? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_222.wav,123212,If so have I expressed them clearly and appropriately? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_223.wav,158796,And then do I intent to investigate a relationship between difference phenomena or variable? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_224.wav,140172,"If so, have I indicated the variable that I think may be related? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_225.wav,170924,The next stage for the development of research proposal is the review of literature. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_226.wav,156236,"It was noted earlier that in order to gain support for a proposal project, the researcher "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_227.wav,100492,will need to conduct a review of the literature. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_228.wav,136364,In a research proposal the literature review is a partial summary of the previous work

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_232.wav,65612,relevance to your planned study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_233.wav,160396,The major weakness of the many literature review is that people cite references without 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_234.wav,141804,indicating either their relevance or their implication for the planned study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_235.wav,128652,"Within any research proposal, a literature review is design to serve the twin purpose "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_237.wav,99564,and also the methodological strategy to be adopted. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_238.wav,186252,The writer’s task is to employ the literature review artfully to support and explain the

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_241.wav,65676,This is a very important point. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_242.wav,179884,"Many people are tempted to reference every study, every article, and every book that "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_246.wav,166444,"And of course, you need to review the literature related to your research question in order "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_247.wav,203564,for instance to identify a research gap that will serve as a stimulus for your study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_248.wav,203532,"However, the space available for you to develop this is in your research proposal will be limited. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_249.wav,187276,"You will therefore need to be concise in your review and refer only that work that is to, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_253.wav,211532,Remember the literature review for a research proposal is somewhat different from that which

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_255.wav,118412,"It is quite obvious, more modest in scale and breadth. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_256.wav,185676,It is not the place to review body of literature that bears on a problematic area or even the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_257.wav,187212,place to examine all the researches that relates to the specific question raised in the proposal. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_258.wav,127404,Cormack in his book ‘The Research Process in Nursing’ provides a useful overview of

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_426.wav,160652,The amount of time you need to devote to your study should be set out in the proposal. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_427.wav,211564,It may be that this is a proposal for a full time commitment or perhaps for only a few hours in a week. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_428.wav,166156,"But whichever is the case, the research proposal must specify the amount of time involved. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_429.wav,138252,The review committee will need to know how long the project will take when considering

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_431.wav,162604,Describing particular form of expertise or backup facilities can strengthen a proposal. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_432.wav,140844,Good computer and library facilities fall into this category. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_433.wav,154604,Where established network are integral to a project or cooperation has been obtained

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_437.wav,150156,Preparing a research budget is as much as skill as preparing other parts of the proposal. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_20_Research_Proposal_438.wav,170604,Part of the skill lies in locating the other people who knows the price of all appropriate

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_23.wav,306252,"In this module, we shall primarily cover the meaning of research, the purpose of research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_24.wav,62156,What is legal research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_25.wav,183084,"The purpose of legal research, broad nature of legal research, various kinds of legal "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_28.wav,120364,we have learnt so far. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_29.wav,92844,Starting with the meaning of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_30.wav,161004,A term can be best understood with reference to the purpose it seeks to achieve. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_31.wav,170604,The purpose of research is either to know about or to contribute something new to the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_32.wav,74924,existing state of knowledge. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_33.wav,178892,The former can be described as the ‘disinterested search for knowledge and understanding for 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_34.wav,242956,"its own sake’, while the latter is an application based approach to the problems in the real world. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_35.wav,240652,The prefix re before research signifies a continuum which verifies or supplements existing knowledge. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_36.wav,182476,"It involves a systematic, careful, diligent and thorough investigation into a specific "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_37.wav,185324,question with a primary objective of contributing to the existing knowledge. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_38.wav,214124,"A directionless, unspecific, unsystematic and mere surface brushing would give us results "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_39.wav,140172,that cannot reveal realistic outcomes. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_40.wav,77196,What is the purpose of research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_41.wav,178604,Apart from general understanding that is basic research or to find something new as applied 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_42.wav,163244,research in broader terms or research fulfils following objectives. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_43.wav,122604,"First, contribute to existing knowledge and a discipline. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_44.wav,220204,"Secondly, to inform policy making and thirdly to address a specific issue or question. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_45.wav,252844,"We will start with describing the first point, that is to contribute to existing knowledge "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_46.wav,90604,"in a discipline for example, law. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_47.wav,135084,Research can give us new set of perspectives at looking at things. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_48.wav,233964,"For example, historical events are continuously revised and reviewed on the basis of research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_49.wav,198764,"Therefore, the version of history might not be the same for two different set of generations. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_50.wav,166444,"Given that, many of us would believe them to be unchangeable given their facts, but "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_51.wav,142764,still it can be argued that they can be viewed from a different lens. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_52.wav,149164,This had a positive impact on existing state of knowledge in a particular discipline in 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_53.wav,104684,the sense that it expands its horizons. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_54.wav,108204,"Second, to inform policy making. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_55.wav,176684,"For example, policy making as to crime, as to housing policy, etcetera. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_56.wav,87084,Research also informs policy questions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_57.wav,221484,"For example, research can be used to address socio-economic issues, say education as to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_58.wav,180204,how it can be given a direction as to ensure growth in a nation or say as to how to best 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_59.wav,181772,avoid food wastage and can there be a space for law to tackle these issues. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_60.wav,220556,These kinds of researches inform policy making which ultimately reflects in the law and decision making. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_61.wav,129324,"Thirdly, to address a specific issue or question. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_62.wav,123244,"Say for example, substance abuse in campus. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_63.wav,146892,Research findings are also used to answer a specific issue at hand. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_64.wav,181804,It is stemmed from the concerns that the conventional researchers were not having much impact and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_65.wav,167116,thereby new approaches that were seen as being more relevant and practical in the real world 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_66.wav,66924,settings were developed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_67.wav,191724,"It can be action research which is both diagnose a specific issue and attempt to solve it, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_68.wav,102444,thereby to improve practice in some way. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_69.wav,167404,Also it may be evaluation which assesses the existing state of affairs in an era wherein 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_70.wav,181484,"the accountability has increased, that requires a constant reassessment about the worth or "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_71.wav,164524,usefulness of a particular service policy or other intervention. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_72.wav,32044,Describing legal research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_73.wav,180492,Taking a cue from the discussion above legal research can be understood as a systematic 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_74.wav,196556,"finding or ascertainment of law on an identified topic or in the given area, as well as an "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_75.wav,173484,enquiry into law with a view of making advancement in the science of law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_76.wav,154284,This is not an easy task to find the law in a vast mass of statutes which are constantly 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_77.wav,213484,"amended and supplemented by rules, regulations, orders, directives, ordinances, judgement "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_78.wav,82572,of courts and bylaws. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_79.wav,157836,Also for making advancement in the science of law requires a systematic probe into the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_80.wav,105324,underlying principle of and reasons for law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_81.wav,80044,"Thus, legal research has a broad ambit to it. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_82.wav,274924,"It has to be continuously done by legislators, judges, lawyers, law students and law teachers. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_83.wav,132524,"Now, what is the purpose of research? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_84.wav,65324,Law does not sit in a vacuum. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_85.wav,121324,"Instead, it operates in a complex social context. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_86.wav,176684,It reflects attitudes and behavioural norms and also control and mould them. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_87.wav,143084,"However, as these norms are al… also temporal spatial. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_88.wav,184684,"However, as these norms are also temporal spatial that is changing with time and space. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_89.wav,221484,"It is desires that law has to adapt and be dynamic in order to cope with the changes, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_90.wav,199052,thereby legal research becomes essential for ascertainment of law to point out ambiguities 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_91.wav,201356,"and weaknesses of law, to critically examine the laws in order to ensure coherence, consistency "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_92.wav,182124,and stability of law and its underlying policy to conduct a social audit of the law and to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_93.wav,67884,suggest reforms in the law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_94.wav,88044,Taking them one by one. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_95.wav,223052,"First, ascertaining the law, in a complex mass of legal statutes and coupled with allied "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_96.wav,150796,legal material it is not always easy to find the law on a particular point. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_97.wav,208684,They are scattered and a single issue may involve application of various laws. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_98.wav,77484,Judicial pronouncements adds to the complexity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_99.wav,156204,"A researcher needs to locate, analyse and understand these pronouncements. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_100.wav,232684,"So, the process involves an intensive analysis of legal instruments and judicial pronouncements. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_101.wav,111724,"Now, highlighting the ambiguities and gaps. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_102.wav,203884,A law is not designed to address every contingency that might arise in future because it is the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_103.wav,180204,"nature of law that it is reactive, it answers to problems which had arisen and seldom is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_104.wav,67244,it that it is proactive. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_105.wav,173804,"Secondly, even in the physiology of provision may not fit with the legislative intent or "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_106.wav,114604,may not match with other provisions of the act. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_107.wav,111724,Research highlights these gaps and inbuilt ambiguities. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_108.wav,244204,"Thirdly, to determine coherence, stability and consistency via a process of critical "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_109.wav,40684,evaluation of the law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_110.wav,184044,"A researcher can exhibit the consistency, coherence and stability in the law. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_111.wav,168044,"This helps in future designing and development of law, legal provision or doctrine, as the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_112.wav,57004,case may be. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_113.wav,104684,"Fourth, social auditing of law. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_114.wav,186924,It is a pre-legislative step then in order to understand and appreciate the social factors 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_115.wav,109164,that had an impact on the making of law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_116.wav,203244,It enables one to know the stakes the law intends to protect or change and reasons for the same. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_117.wav,193644,Such an audit helps to identify gap if any between the legal ideal and the social reality 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_118.wav,96364,and to know the reasons responsible thereof. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_119.wav,104684,It also enables us to predict the future of law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_120.wav,109164,"Now, fifthly, suggesting reforms. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_121.wav,143084,In the light of the research reforms can be proposed in precise terms. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_122.wav,206764,"These outcomes can be on the basis of an analytical, historical and comparative research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_123.wav,130284,"Now, what are the broad nature of the legal research? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_124.wav,173484,On the basis of data collection and analysis two broad categories can be used to describe 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_125.wav,51564,different approaches. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_126.wav,170604,"First, the quantitative legal research and secondly, the qualitative legal research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_127.wav,154284,"First, we will discuss the quantitative legal research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_128.wav,179244,"The quantitative research is characterized with surveys, structured interviews, experiments, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_129.wav,99244,tests as tools for data collection. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_130.wav,141164,It produces data which can be made subject to statistical analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_131.wav,102444,"So, the findings can be presented in numerical forms. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_132.wav,187564,"For example, a questionnaire asked respondents to tick the appropriate box in order to answer "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_133.wav,163884,the question as to whether they agree or disagree with the particular proposition. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_134.wav,165804,This gives an opportunity to the researcher to quantify the data and calculate how many 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_135.wav,77804,people made a particular point. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_136.wav,229804,"Now, coming to qualitative legal research, participant observation and structured interviews "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_137.wav,78188,or life histories are some of the qualitative research methods. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_138.wav,161900,The outcome is presented in the form of descriptions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_139.wav,153644,The reason it become important was that the feeling that quantitative research does not 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_140.wav,174124,take into account the differences between people and the objects of natural science. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_141.wav,158124,It seems to be artificial and distant from everyday life that the findings might not 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_142.wav,63724,represent the reality. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_143.wav,175724,These led many researchers to adopt more qualitative methods which allow researchers to get closer 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_144.wav,128044,to the people they are investigating. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_145.wav,93164,What are the different kinds of legal research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_146.wav,172524,The basic type of research can be broadly classified in various subsets wherein they 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_147.wav,123564,can be understood in comparison with another kind of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_148.wav,212844,"Those are descriptive and analytical legal research, applied and pure legal research, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_149.wav,199404,"quantitative and qualitative legal research, conceptual and empirical legal research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_150.wav,174124,"First, discussing the descriptive and analytical legal research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_151.wav,135724,The former describe the state of affairs as it exits. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_152.wav,182764,"It describes the phenomena, reporting what has happened and what is happening without "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_153.wav,96044,going into the reason or cause for the same. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_154.wav,173804,"The tools used are surveys, comparative and core… correlational method. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_155.wav,211884,"The tools used are surveys, comparative and correlational methods and fact finding enquiries, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_156.wav,129964,but it does not establish any relationship between the variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_157.wav,161964,"The analytical research however, uses the fact and information available to make a critical "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_158.wav,52204,evaluation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_159.wav,140524,"Second, applied and pure legal research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_160.wav,173804,"The aim of the former is to find a solution to a present, practical problem at hand. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_161.wav,81324,Researchers put it in a practical context. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_162.wav,167724,The later focuses on generalisation and formulation of a theory. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_163.wav,134764,Its aim is to broaden the understanding of a particular field of investigation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_164.wav,128684,The researcher does not focus upon the practical utility of the results. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_165.wav,185964,In case of quantitative and qualitative legal research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_166.wav,176364,"As mentioned, the former is about quantity or amount that is what can be expressed in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_167.wav,65644,numerical form of results. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_168.wav,172844,"The later, however, aims at garnishing views and opinions to give outcomes. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_169.wav,228844,It relies on reasons behind a particular behavioural aspect. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_170.wav,95404,"The fourth, conceptual and empirical legal research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_171.wav,147244,The conceptual research is related with an abstract notion on an idea. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_172.wav,157804,Generally resorted to by the philosophers and thinkers to develop new concepts or reinterpret 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_173.wav,59564,the existing concepts. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_174.wav,132204,"The later, however, relies upon experience and observation alone. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_175.wav,260844,It is databased coming up with results that can be verified by observations or experiments. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_176.wav,67884,What are the major kind of legal research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_177.wav,247756,"The other major methods used in legal research are doctrinal legal research, non-doctrinal "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_178.wav,95692,"legal research, comparative legal research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_179.wav,221164,"First, we will discuss what is meant by doctrinal legal research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_180.wav,160332,The central question of enquiry here is what is the law on a particular issue. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_181.wav,191756,It is concerned with finding the law vigorously analysing it and coming up with a logical 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_182.wav,53804,reasoning behind it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_183.wav,198124,"Therefore, it immensely contribute to the continuity, consistency and certainty of law. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_184.wav,190124,The basic material can be found in the statutory material that is primary sources as well in 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_185.wav,62124,the secondary material. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_186.wav,189164,"However, the research has its own limitations it is subjective that is limited to the perception "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_187.wav,168684,of the researcher away from the actual working of the law devoid of factors that led outside 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_188.wav,189484,the periphery of law and fails to focus on the actual practice of the courts. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_189.wav,167084,"Now, what is non-doctrinal legal research? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_190.wav,105964,Non-doctrinal legal research is also known as socio-legal research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_191.wav,154924,It leads into how the law and legal institutions moulds and affect the society. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_192.wav,193004,It employs methods taken from other disciplines in order to generate an empirical data to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_193.wav,57004,answer the questions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_194.wav,142444,It can either be answering a problem like to find the gap between idealism and social 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_195.wav,212844,"reality, could be tracing the results of legal decisions, can also assess impact of non-legal "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_196.wav,135724,factors upon legal processes or decisions or may be an reform-based approach. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_197.wav,239084,"It is about viewing law from the perspective of a different discipline it, to keep it organic "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_198.wav,132844,"and growing, that is to put things in a context. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_199.wav,161004,Being empirical it is vital and valuable in revealing and expanding the legal practice 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_200.wav,211244,"and procedures and their impact on range of social institutions like family, businesses, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_201.wav,84524,"citizens, consumers. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_202.wav,152684,"Thirdly, what is comparative legal research? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_203.wav,220204,"Comparative legal research involves a comparison of legal doctrines, legislations via the foreign laws.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_204.wav,190732,"It highlights the cultural and social character of law and how does it acts in different settings, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_205.wav,143724,so it is useful in developing and amending and modifying the law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_206.wav,148844,But a cautious approach has to be taken in blindly accepting the law of another socio 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_207.wav,226604,setting as an ideal because it might not act in the same manner in a different setting. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_208.wav,90636,What are the sources of information? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_209.wav,188844,The various sources of information can be classified into primary and secondary sources. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_210.wav,156844,Primary source is that source that contain authoritative records of law made by law making 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_211.wav,101484,bodies is a primary source. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_212.wav,222124,"They can be legislation, rules, regulations, orders, bylaws by delegated legis, authorities "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_213.wav,141804,and the authoritative decisions of the courts. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_214.wav,64044,Source of information. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_215.wav,161964,The secondary sources are the one that refer and relate to the law while not being themselves 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_216.wav,41324,primary sources. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_217.wav,223084,"For example, legal commentaries, abstracts, dictionaries, encyclopaedia and index. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_218.wav,80652,What are the processes of a legal research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_219.wav,171916,Research is a process involving backward and forward movement between different stages 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_220.wav,92204,so they cannot be as neatly separated. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_221.wav,197484,"Nevertheless, they can be divided into the following for understanding the different stages. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_222.wav,171564,"Choosing a focal point of research, review of literature, formulation of hypothesis, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_223.wav,257964,"research design, data collection, data analysis, interpretation of data and finally the report. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_224.wav,142444,"Now, we shall discuss these points. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_225.wav,179884,"Choosing a focal point of research, identifying and formulating a legal problem is the first "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_226.wav,59564,step in the process. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_227.wav,185004,If ill-defined and not properly formulated researcher is bound to lose interest in the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_228.wav,171884,"The researcher has to have a precise goal in sight, for that purpose it is necessary "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_229.wav,175724,"for the researcher to identify an area of general interest from the field, an area of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_230.wav,140204,specific interest and within that area of specific interest a particular aspect that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_231.wav,209004,"he would like to enquire into, that would signify the focus and direction of his enquiry "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_232.wav,156844,"that has to be based on a study done from the secondary sources like a commentary, a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_233.wav,150764,scholarly article like Blackstone’s commentaries on the laws of England. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_234.wav,164524,"Secondary sources would point a researcher to the primary source of the law, namely legislative "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_235.wav,119724,tax and judicial decisions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_236.wav,58604,Second comes the review of literature. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_237.wav,204204,It is necessary because it would make the result to be both valued and valuable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_238.wav,182444,It is a survey of the existing related works in order to find out as to what has already 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_239.wav,83884,been discussed on the particular aspect. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_240.wav,145004,It will also give an understanding as to what has not been discussed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_241.wav,183724,"The researcher’s aim is to contribute something new to the existing state of knowledge, so "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_242.wav,90924,"therefore, he has to choose from the later area. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_243.wav,175724,This also justifies his research and makes it an original contribution. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_244.wav,185004,It also helps in avoiding the possible pitfalls and informs areas that might have been neglected 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_245.wav,76844,in the research questions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_246.wav,115244,Third comes the formulation of hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_247.wav,173804,On the basis of an extensive literature survey a researcher might rephrase or reformulate 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_248.wav,175372,"the problem that can be depending upon the nature of research, can be in the form of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_249.wav,192716,"a mere statement or a proposition indicating relationship between variables, the validity "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_250.wav,68524,of which is not known. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_251.wav,80044,Such propositions are known as hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_252.wav,202284,"So, it is a tentative statement the validity or invalidity of which has yet to be tested "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_253.wav,68524,on the basis of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_254.wav,187852,"The manner in which it is formulated gives a hint of methods required, kind of data needed, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_255.wav,142476,and the method of analysis required for the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_256.wav,79084,Then comes the research design. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_257.wav,113324,Research design signifies the structure of the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_258.wav,174124,"It is characterized by a logical systematic planning of the research, a blueprint. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_259.wav,164844,Though it may be tentative as the researcher cannot foresee all the contingencies that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_260.wav,192044,might arise and thus he can adapt as required which would increase the efficiency and reliability 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_261.wav,121324,of his findings. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_262.wav,188844,"After this comes data collection, data collection involves decision making as to the method "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_263.wav,167724,to be employ to collect the data that determines the fate of the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_264.wav,169644,For determining the appropriate method a researcher has to keep in mind the objectives of the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_265.wav,85484,research and the scope of the enquiry. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_266.wav,81644,Data may be primary or secondary. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_267.wav,94764,Data collected by primary source is primary. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_268.wav,161004,While one collected from other agency or available in some published form is secondary. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_269.wav,175404,A data has to be relevant and authoritative that would primarily depend upon the scope 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_270.wav,136044,and focus of the research question. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_271.wav,129964,After collecting data we analyse the data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_272.wav,129324,"Therefore, the next task after data collection is analysis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_273.wav,189484,The raw data has to be put it to analysis so as to reflect the direction and trend. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_274.wav,60524,Analysis happens before interpretation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_275.wav,169644,There is no clear cut demarcation between the two as analysis is not complete without 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_276.wav,116524,interpretation and interpretation cannot precede analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_277.wav,112044,They are thus interdependent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_279.wav,130924,In a legal research cases are also required to be analysed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_280.wav,151724,"However, with the caution the two different set of facts can lead to different outcomes "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_281.wav,153004,or may be for the same reason that an earlier case law can be distinguished on the basis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_282.wav,63084,of question of law raised. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_283.wav,215052,It is the drawing inferences from the collected data that interpretation is done. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_284.wav,112044,Interpretation can be inductive or deductive. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_285.wav,127436,Inductive is inference from particular propositions to general propositions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_286.wav,201324,While deductive is inferences from general propositions to particular propositions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_287.wav,191084,The interpretation give the broader meaning to research findings and as well trigger new researchers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_288.wav,174444,"However, caution must be exercised in interpreting the data. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_289.wav,74924,It needs to be impartial and objective. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_290.wav,221804,A wrong interpretation can lead to inaccurate and misleading conclusions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_291.wav,91564,After interpretation comes the report. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_292.wav,118764,"Thus, the last phase is report writing. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_293.wav,189804,"Though this, through this the researcher communicates his work to the audience. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_294.wav,188524,"Report contains significant facts, those are the problem, method used and the findings "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_295.wav,48684,arrived at by the researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_296.wav,224044,It has to be original and with precise clarity in communicating the results. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_297.wav,99884,What are the major problems in legal research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_298.wav,158764,The major problems while undertaking a legal research are as follows. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_299.wav,97964,"First, cultural problems. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_300.wav,108204,"Secondly, structural and procedural problems. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_301.wav,128684,"For example, unsympathetic attitude of authorities. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_302.wav,78732,"Thirdly, lack of resources. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_303.wav,199436,"For example, access to money, access to the information, etcetera. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_304.wav,231404,"Incompetence, for example, inadequate planning and lack of networking and forums. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_305.wav,208044,"Thus, we can summarize what we have learnt so far. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_306.wav,187244,Legal research is a systematic understanding of the law with a view of its advancement. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_307.wav,168044,The purposes of the same are very important to the people and society because law acts 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_308.wav,137964,within the society and the both had an impact on each other. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_309.wav,95404,Every kind of research method had its own value. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_310.wav,202924,"However, while undertaking a research a researcher might face some hurdles, but they can be avoided "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_2_Legal_Research_311.wav,71084,by proper planning of the research process. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_0.wav,32044,Hello everyone. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_1.wav,67244,Welcome back to the Research meth… 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_2.wav,40012,Methodology modules. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_3.wav,122316,And today we have reached to the last module that is Report Writing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_4.wav,150764,"So, this is the most important aspect because this is the most important thing that you "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_5.wav,63404,do about your research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_6.wav,64012,"As you know, I am Doctor Ritu Sharma. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_7.wav,67276,We have done various modules together. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_8.wav,171884,"Today, I am going to discuss with you the module on Report Writing. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_9.wav,180524,"In this, I am going to talk about the ways in which research writing links theory with practice. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_10.wav,193004,"Then we are going to see the aims of research writing, and then will sentis… sensitize "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_11.wav,176972,the readers to the need to communicate and their research with their audience and then 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_12.wav,170924,to provide readers with the framework within which they can write up their research reports. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_13.wav,162284,"Finally, to provide a practical guidance of the management of the writing process and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_14.wav,81004,enable a good reference and citation practice. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_15.wav,210604,The culmination of a research project arrives when all the hard work is put to paper and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_16.wav,135116,the fruits of our labor are shared with a wider audience. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_17.wav,193644,"This means writang… writing up for research in a way that presents not just our findings, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_18.wav,117804,but the process through which we arrive at these findings. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_19.wav,238156,"It demands an honesty about our research design and our perspective, so that others can understand "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_20.wav,208332,"not just the research we have produced, but something about the way in which we have produced it  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_21.wav,227884,"The foundation for this approach writing is that research projects do not exist in isolation, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_22.wav,171884,but contribute to a wider body of knowledge that is constantly developing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_23.wav,221164,"In exploring the writer write-up process, it is useful to consider Denscombe’s view "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_24.wav,207404,that there are some common themes and shared concerns that underline formal reports of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_25.wav,139244,research across the spectrum of approaches within the social sciences. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_26.wav,215404,"There is some general consensus that when writing up research, the aim is to explain "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_27.wav,185004,"the purpose of the research, describe how the research was done, present the findings "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_28.wav,198092,"from the research, discuss and analyze the findings, and reach the conclusions. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_29.wav,239724,These five aims form a useful basis upon which to approach the writing of a research project. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_30.wav,241036,"As Denscombe suggests, this appears to be one area, at least, where there I agree of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_31.wav,54412,consensus among researchers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_32.wav,233036,Qualitative and quantitative researchers may disagree on the precise layout or presentation 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_33.wav,215724,"of reports, and we shall acknowledge this, but for our purpose, the mutual aims of writing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_34.wav,138284,up provide a useful focus for our discussion. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_35.wav,193644,Addressing the research question with your data is the first thing that we are going to discuss.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_36.wav,179884,"When presenting the outcome of our research, it is important to return to the very beginning "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_37.wav,130604,and ask ourselves what was the purpose of this research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_38.wav,216684,"The research process can be lengthy, and time spent in the field, or mulling over the reams "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_39.wav,202604,"data, can make the point of origin of our research seems like a dim and distant memory. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_56.wav,124204,question should be used to guide the primary focus of a writing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_57.wav,201964,One of the greatest barriers researcher face when it comes to writing up is tackling the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_58.wav,136364,"program of what to write about, and how to organize it. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_59.wav,201644,"The research question can be used as guidance here, since it provides us with the framework "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_71.wav,92524,They rarely examine the process of writing itself. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_72.wav,254444,"A possible reason for this, as Bingham suggest is that, ‘writing has become viewed as a "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_84.wav,197484,It’s time to take a break and reflect on what we have done so far.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_87.wav,226924,"Before we look at strategies for the actual process of writing, there are a few practical "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_88.wav,149484,things that we can do in advance that will make the process easier. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_89.wav,249004,Cuba and Cocking suggest that appraising the environment in which we do a writing can be benificail.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_90.wav,211244,"They suggest that a number of questions relating to where, when, and how we write need to be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_91.wav,116524,addressed before we actually sit down to write. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_92.wav,76524,Some of these questions are outlined below. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_93.wav,146604,Is there a dedicated environment in which we can write? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_94.wav,185964,"If we are fortunate enough to have an office or study in which we can work, then this may "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_95.wav,92204,prove to be the ideal environment. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_96.wav,173484,"If we are going to be using a shared environment, a shared office, university computer room, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_97.wav,274284,"a family room, the library, then we need to access at what time the space will be exclusively available to us.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_98.wav,201004,"Being interrupted during a particular productive writing session can be extremely frustrating,  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_99.wav,226284,so it is important to plan to write at times when interruptions are least likely. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_100.wav,162252,"The next question that comes to our mind is, when is the best time of day to write? "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_105.wav,65644,it will be worth it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_106.wav,123564,How are we going to store our writings? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_107.wav,125804,Most formal writing nowadays is carried out on a word processor. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_108.wav,177964,This means thinking about electronic storage and peripherals such as printers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_109.wav,182764,Saving work regularly is a habit most definitely worth getting into. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_110.wav,127724,Most word processing software packages have auto save features. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_111.wav,215084,By enabling these and making regular backup copies on other disk and storage devices we 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_112.wav,225324,can avoid any any of the heart attack of losing a days’ worth of work.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_114.wav,201964,"on the server of our email client, which in turn will be regularly backed up. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_115.wav,93164,How familiar are we with the software? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_116.wav,144364,That's another question that we need to loo… s… look into. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_117.wav,176044,Word processing skills are common features of school curriculum and we often taught at 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_118.wav,197804,"universities nowadays, but it is worth investigating the software we are using for additional features "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_119.wav,104364,which may make the process of writing easier.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_121.wav,184364,and production of complex document a lot more manageable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_122.wav,209324,Features such as word's auto-correct function enable abbreviations or shorthands to be used 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_123.wav,103404,in place of words that are going to be used frequently. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_124.wav,230444,"The software is told which characters to replace with other words, so as the abbreviations "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_125.wav,179244,"are entered, they are overwritten by the corresponding full length words or phrase. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_126.wav,220524,"It is worth becoming familiar with these features prior to starting our writing, and also investigating "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_127.wav,157164,additional software that can be used to manage and organize references.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_131.wav,190444,We have to recognize that different approaches to writing work better with some authors than 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_132.wav,167404,"the others, and that our audience will partly dictate the way in which we write. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_135.wav,133772,This is one area where there does appear to be some consensus.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_145.wav,267916,The very first thing the and the most important thing for a report writing is the title of the report. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_146.wav,72684,Sometimes the most obvious elements are overlooked. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_147.wav,226924,The title of the research should be made to be concise but also give a flavor of the purpose 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_148.wav,32044,of the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_149.wav,164204,The title does not have to be the same as the research questions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_150.wav,89004,This can be applied as a subtitle. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_151.wav,216364,"But sometimes when we have a whole series of research questions, even this may not be appropriate.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_152.wav,195596,To try to frame all of the objectives and research questions in the title would have 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_153.wav,253740,"been futile, so instead the instead you choose the far shorter version that appears in print. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_154.wav,193036,"In addition to the title, the front page should contain the name of the author, date, name "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_157.wav,88364,in mind is to write an abstract. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_158.wav,206764,"The abstract, while appearing at the front of the report, should be written last of all. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_159.wav,227244,In order to understand the purpose of an abstract it is useful to consider where we might come across them. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_160.wav,195244,"Earlier in the chapter, we mentioned using a database to aid with the literature searches. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_161.wav,167084,These often consist of a collection of abstracts which enable the researcher to decide upon

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_185.wav,205484,This means starting from the reader’s present knowledge and leading him or her on to seeing 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_186.wav,190764,that the topic is worth spending some time investigating.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_215.wav,71404,"Finally, ethical consideration arising from the research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_216.wav,294444,One of the commitment we have as a researcher is to share not just what we have learnt from

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_223.wav,213484,We need to ask whether the methods we applied were appropriate to our study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_33_Report_Writing_224.wav,241964,Key issues that have been addressed throughout this can be used to shape our methodological evaluation.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_15.wav,194316,The term quantitative method refers in large part of the adoption of the natural sciences 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_16.wav,82924,experiment as the model for scientific research.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_25.wav,132524,A method that is particularly popular in social sciences research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_26.wav,154604,The sample survey is the most commonly used technique for gathering information whether 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_27.wav,56684,by quantitative or qualitative. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_28.wav,200364,Surveys are based on using statistical sampling method by taking a representative sample from 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_29.wav,187564,a given population and applying a standard research instrument in the form of a structured 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_30.wav,183724,questionnaire surveys enable descriptive and explanatory generalization to be made about

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_50.wav,179564,Together with an overview of the debate concerning the legitimacy of these quantitative method 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_51.wav,70124,within the social sciences. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_52.wav,157164,Experimental research – Experiments are most commonly used in psychological research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_53.wav,194604,"and in the broad field of business studies, particularly in organizational research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_54.wav,217004,Experimental research is based on researcher manipulating certain controlled conditions 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_55.wav,144332,in order to identify the relationship between particular variables that it is hoped will 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_56.wav,93484,explain cause-and-effect relationship. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_57.wav,201324,In seeking to measure the impact that one factor has on another by controlling all the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_58.wav,210604,"other factor that might have an effect, experimental research build on the principle of a positivist "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_59.wav,159756,approach to science more than any other research techniques. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_60.wav,128652,Experiments can be carried out in either a laboratory or a field setting. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_61.wav,172556,"Laboratory experimentation is most closely regulated method of experiment, involving "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_62.wav,146284,the introduction of certain conditions into a controlled environment that stimulates key 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_63.wav,97644,characteristic of a natural environment. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_64.wav,224332,An example might be to the examining the extent to which the responses of a group of voters 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_65.wav,223084,to question about political attitude after exposure to a series of party election broadcast 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_66.wav,208716,might be different from another yet identical groups response when it has not been confronted 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_67.wav,57004,with such images. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_68.wav,176332,"Such experiments allow for very considerable control on behalf of the researcher, who is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_69.wav,227276,able to effect change and observe research participant’s subsequent behavior. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_70.wav,139212,Experiments conducted outside the laboratory take place in a natural environment under 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_71.wav,98924,as carefully controlled condition as possible. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_72.wav,228844,An example might be a situation in which researcher stage a physical attack in a public place 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_73.wav,208044,to examine people's response to the incident as an investigation of a bystander apathy. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_74.wav,78124,Field experiments are somewhat different. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_75.wav,188204,"Here, experiment principles are applied to live social events and therefore permits the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_76.wav,137676,"study of phenomenon, which ethical or practical consideration would normally rule out. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_77.wav,242284,"Essentially, the researcher measure the effect of an intervention which is occurring naturally. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_78.wav,199724,"Such projects, which measure variables without manipulating them are often called quasi-experiment "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_79.wav,98284,or non-experimental designs. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_80.wav,173804,An example might be a comparison of voter turnout for local election in two different 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_81.wav,178252,"areas, one where a new initiative has been introduced by a local authority, voting by "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_82.wav,98924,telephone and one where it has not. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_83.wav,158444,The role of the researcher will be to measure any change in the voting levels that allow 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_84.wav,183084,"from the initiative, to examine whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_85.wav,204204,the two variables which is in that case are voting methods and voter turnout rate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_86.wav,167724,Establishing causality – Experimental research is based on testing a hypothesis stating a 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_87.wav,158124,relationship between a dependentable variable and an independent variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_88.wav,139596,A dependable variable is the variable that the researcher wishes to explain. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_89.wav,147532,"And an ind… independent variable is the variable, the variable that researcher expects "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_90.wav,111084,to explain the change in the dependable variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_91.wav,205516,"If we can determine that the two variables or phenomenon vary, then we can say that we "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_92.wav,113292,have established a ka… co-variation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_93.wav,241964,"For example, we may be able to establish co-variation between personal income and political conservatism. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_94.wav,189164,"However, simply being also able to say that a change in the level of income is associated "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_95.wav,199084,with the change in conservatism is rather limited in terms of scientific explanation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_96.wav,183756,"In the majority of cases, researchers will want to go beyond co-variation to demo… "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_97.wav,184012,demonstrate causality that a change in the independent variable causes a change in the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_98.wav,42284,dependent variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_99.wav,229164,"To be able to establish causality, it must be possible to establish the time order of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_100.wav,98636,"event, that the effect follows the cause. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_101.wav,154572,"In the natural sciences where the experiments are carried out under highly controlled condition, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_102.wav,169644,the verification of causality is not particularly problematic. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_103.wav,203564,"For example, it is relatively straightforward to determine that the application of heat "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_104.wav,86764,to water causes it to boil. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_105.wav,178956,"However, in the social world we are often faced with co-varying relationship where causality "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_106.wav,53452,is far from clear-cut. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_107.wav,240396,"To return to our example of income and political conservatism, it is possible to argue that "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_190.wav,215084,Experimental research raises a number of ethical dilemmas concerning the manner in which researchers treat people.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_192.wav,165132,in the same way as laboratory animals such as mice and guinea pigs are treated. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_193.wav,209356,An additional ethical consideration in relation to experimental research is the question of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_194.wav,179244,"including or excluding people from a study in which some way, some may benefit. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_200.wav,179244,One way around such a charge of unethical abuse of power by the researcher is to take

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_246.wav,175404,Academics are not the only people who use survey method as research method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_247.wav,132204,Other users of surveys can be broadly categorized as follows. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_248.wav,151724,"One, government and its agencies, voluntary sector organizations and campaign groups use "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_249.wav,241004,"survey research to inform the influence of the political, economic and social policy-making process. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_250.wav,208044,"Then, business of all sizes carry out surveys in their quest for gaining a lead in the market "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_251.wav,148844,for their product by differentiating their product against those of their competitors. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_252.wav,193004,"Third, the media and the political parties carry out public opinion polls on voting intentions, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_253.wav,118124,partly political leaders and their polity policies. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_254.wav,213804,Survey research can be used to obtain multifaceted data from an individual. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_255.wav,191084,"On the behavior, straight forward questions on what the respondent has done or is doing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_256.wav,69484,or may doing the future. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_257.wav,203564,"For example, it is possible to ask people if they use public transport for certain journeys "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_258.wav,88684,or if they are vegetarian. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_259.wav,147884,Then there are questions on belief like what people think will happen. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_260.wav,93484,What do they believe is true or false? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_261.wav,175724,Do people believe that the National Health Service is safer in the hands of the current

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_263.wav,140844,"Then there are questions of attitudes, how people think and feel about certain things. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_264.wav,198764,"For example, whether people consider that women with per-school children should participate "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_265.wav,37484,in the workforce. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_266.wav,48684,Question on attributes. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_267.wav,175724,"These are the personal question that concern the characteristics of the respondent, such "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_268.wav,156524,"as his or her age, sex, ethnicity, religion and employment status. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_269.wav,178604,"As such, these questions have the potential to be viewed as a sensitive question. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_270.wav,115244,They are often referred to as classification questions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_271.wav,181164,"By employing a combination of such question in a survey, the skillful researchers open "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_272.wav,144364,up the possibility of describing and explaining complex social phenomena. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_273.wav,199724,"Now, let us understand the Method of Data Collection in a Quantitative Research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_274.wav,140524,There are four main types of data collection method for a social survey. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_275.wav,220524,"First one, the face-to-face interview, where the respondent is questioned in person by an interviewer. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_276.wav,217644,The main advantage of this method is that it usually results in a relatively high response rate.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_277.wav,199724,"Second, however, such interview commonly incurs high cost due to the number of interviewers "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_278.wav,188844,"that need to be employed, and it is also argued that the personal interaction between the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_279.wav,148524,interviewer and the respondent can lead to a biased response. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_280.wav,161644,"Then in a study that considers questions of child discipline and punishment, it may be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_281.wav,234604,"that respondent will offer the socially acceptable response, the answer that they believe the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_282.wav,57004,interviewer wants to hear. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_283.wav,50956,Second is the Postal Questionnaire. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_284.wav,168332,Postal Questionnaire are widely used because they are relatively cheap to administer and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_285.wav,144684,they enable coverage of a wide geographical area. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_286.wav,178284,"Also given that they avoid direct personal contact, they have the advantage at assuring "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_287.wav,120044,a degree of privacy for the respondent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_288.wav,176044,The main disadvantage associated with the Postal Questionnaire is that they perform 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_289.wav,107564,poorly in relation to response rate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_290.wav,155564,Telephonic interview – They have become more common in the past decade as technologically 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_291.wav,145964,advances have allowed researcher to draw samples with great accuracy. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_292.wav,77484,They are very quick to administer. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_293.wav,169324,"However, they are limited to researchers who have access to the relevant technology such "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_295.wav,220844,Online surveys which are delivered by email or make use of web based form in place of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_296.wav,91884,a questionnaire are now widely used. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_297.wav,171884,They share some of the characteristics of postal surveys in that they are inexpensive 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_298.wav,201324,"to administer, but may have lower response rate than interviewer-administrator surveys. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_299.wav,175084,Access to data – The instant response is sent and being able to draw samples on a global 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_300.wav,173164,"scales are also attractive benefits, but the difference between the characteristic as internet "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_301.wav,175724,users and non-user can result in internet based samples which are not representative 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_302.wav,72044,at the general population. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_303.wav,154924,"Once the data have been collected, the researcher have to codified and process the data in a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_304.wav,155244,manner that is becomes presentable in tabular form and charts. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_305.wav,108844,It should also become accessible for use for statistical treatment that would tell us about 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_306.wav,117804,the different qualities of data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_307.wav,203884,Each of these methods of data collection has its own strength and weaknesses in relation 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_308.wav,207404,"to design, cost, and so on, and in crude terms one`s weakness are often the other’s strength. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_311.wav,150124,Sampling – A very important part of survey method is sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_312.wav,126764,Surveys are often referred to as sample surveys because the information that the researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_313.wav,208684,"wishes to gather is usually collected from a selected group of people, a sample. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_314.wav,173164,It is very unusual for researcher to question all of the people that they wish to study

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_316.wav,94124,Sampling has been dealt as a separate module. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_317.wav,121644,Here we will have a basic idea about the sampling survey. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_318.wav,165484,Sampling is a method that identifies a representative number from a given universe population. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_319.wav,90604,There are two basic properties of sample. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_320.wav,148524,It should be adequate and it should be representative of the universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_321.wav,165164,The most crucial point in sampling is to make sure that one's personal values do not influence 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_322.wav,82284,the selection process. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_323.wav,184044,"In order to keep out the researcher’s bias, various techniques or procedures of selecting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_324.wav,62444,a sample have been suggested. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_325.wav,207724,"To take an often used analogy, one does not need to eat an entire fruit cake to gain an "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_327.wav,78124,The same is the case with the sampling method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_328.wav,218924,The researcher will not need to include all members of the target group of his or her study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_329.wav,113644,"A subset will do, providing it has been selected carefully. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_330.wav,187564,"However, the usual rule is that the larger the subset selected, the higher the level "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_331.wav,127724,of accuracy to be expected in the findings from the sample survey. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_332.wav,172524,"Thus, in survey sampling, the margin of difference between the results from the sample and the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_333.wav,190476,population values referred to as a sampling error is attributed primarily to the method 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_334.wav,119372,"of sample selection and secondly, the size of the sample. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_335.wav,168044,"Methods of sample selection – As we have already discussed sampling methods, here  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_336.wav,152364,I am just going to tell you the names of various sampling methods or techniques. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_337.wav,149804,The details of it can be studied in the module on sampling methods.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_341.wav,69804,and Snowball Sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_342.wav,124204,The next process of survey research is the design of questionnaire. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_343.wav,162924,"A good questionnaire should include a mix of closed, open and scaled questions. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_344.wav,185964,"Furthermore, it will take into account the type of data to be collected and the resources, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_345.wav,97324,time and money that are available for the study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_346.wav,188844,A good question is also one in which the questions that have been asked are well crafted and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_347.wav,92204,are the product of careful consideration. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_348.wav,209004,"In designing the questionnaire, researcher should do their utmost to avoid the many pitfalls "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_349.wav,178284,"that present themselves, including the use of ambiguous language, a language that is "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_352.wav,198764,Of equal importance is the need to structure the questionnaire so that it aids the progression 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_353.wav,57964,of the interview. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_354.wav,176364,Asking the question in a relatively logical order enables sensible flow to develop. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_355.wav,185644,It should also be borne in mind that overly lengthy questionnaire are likely to put many

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_361.wav,67564,it has been criticized on a number of level. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_362.wav,109804,"The first one, the logic of the sample survey. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_363.wav,153644,Critics argue that the logic of the sample survey in attempting to isolate causal explanation 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_364.wav,100844,between different variables is in itself deficient. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_365.wav,230764,"Given the complexity of human consciousness and behavior, critics hold that survey researchers "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_18_Quantitative_Research_366.wav,191724,will not be able to gain access to the process through which people adopt particular views

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_93.wav,179596,"intimate the relevant, accurate and high quality sources are cited. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_94.wav,229452,In academic writing it is important to track down sources sighted in a form of references 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_95.wav,271404,and noted bibliographies and footnoting to justify the validity and quality of sources 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_96.wav,240684,"used as the base of analysis, discussion and conclusion of the research work done. Now, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_97.wav,202924,we’ll discuss about the structure of citation. All the academic discipline follow their preferred 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_98.wav,174764,style of citation. The basic structure of citation style are developed on the three 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_99.wav,198796,basic formats. First is parenthetical referencing style. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_100.wav,223692,"Well, it is a citation system in which citation to the original source are available within "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_101.wav,188876,"the text of the writing. So, in this citation syst… system partial citations are made "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_102.wav,222732,"using parenthesis, for example, author page, we can write the name of the author or page "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_103.wav,213804,"number, so we can, as you can see in the text, we have written in bracket Russell three fifty. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_104.wav,189516,"Russell is the name of the author and three fifty is the page number or author short title, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_105.wav,197484,so we can use the short title along with the author and page number like Russell arbitration 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_106.wav,57292,three fifty within a bracket. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_107.wav,239724,"So, whether the sources quoted directly or rewritten in own words or refers the idea "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_108.wav,307276,from the source used. It investigates the readers to immediately find from where the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_109.wav,212204,source of information is derived and saves the time used for making footnote and endnotes. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_110.wav,251532,"So, in this system, alphabetical arrangements, alphabetically arranged references of document, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_111.wav,245484,"sources are listed at the end as references, bibliographies or work cited. So, there are "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_112.wav,234956,"mainly two types of parenthetical referencing. So, Or we can say parenthetical citation co-relates "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_113.wav,248972,to a source listed in work cited page. Parenthetical references must have the name of author or 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_114.wav,233036,"authors, date of publication and the page number or numbers which is referred in the text. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_115.wav,160044,"So, you can see in the screen there are some of the examples of it. So, the two different "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_116.wav,223372,type of reference system is noted in parenthetical referencing style is author-date system which

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_129.wav,211852,"we can write the AND word. So, where more than three author contribute or cited paper, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_130.wav,279724,"we can use the word ‘et al’ within quotes. So, in the Author Title or Author Page this "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_131.wav,276556,referencing is quite popular used by researchers in the field of arts and humanities. It is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_34_Citation_Pattern_132.wav,144044,"recommended by the Modern Language Association which is, which is in short also called MLA. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_27.wav,250924,Now there are various kinds of reports depending upon the object of the report and the area. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_28.wav,224716,"There are business reports, project reports, there are dissertations, thesis, there are "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_29.wav,199084,various enquiry reports. There are also legal research reports. This presentation deals 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_30.wav,110764,with how a legal research report is written. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_31.wav,258604,"Now, what is a legal research report? It is a report which deals specifically with a legal "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_32.wav,221452,problem. Such a report is not a complete description of the work done by the researcher.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_33.wav,305356,It is only a brief statement of the most significant facts that are necessary for the understanding 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_34.wav,107244,the generalizations drawn by the investigator. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_35.wav,306924,"Now, there are some basic guidelines for every report writing. First guideline that a report "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_36.wav,175692,writer must keep in mind is the knowledge of the research material. The writer must 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_37.wav,222764,have the comprehensive and adequate knowledge of the research area. It forms the backbone 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_38.wav,243916,of the entire research process and is of vital importance at the time of analysis and interpretation 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_39.wav,121004,of report writing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_40.wav,232044,Second guideline is organizing of the research material. The material collected must be organized 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_41.wav,216684,and the notes made on them manageable and properly arranged with sufficient information 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_42.wav,239084,which may be required. The research information must be logically analyzed and represented 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_43.wav,214732,in the correct sequence of time or occurrence. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_44.wav,218924,Another guideline for the researcher is that he should do a continuous report reflective 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_45.wav,214156,thinking. Researcher constantly reflects on the material and the data collected for a 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_46.wav,291852,"more comprehensive legal report. He should make rough drafts, which will help him with "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_47.wav,204204,research interpretation and generalization in a more accurate and relevant form and will 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_48.wav,183756,also help him test the research questions and the hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_49.wav,224684,Another guideline that a researcher must follow is to rewrite and polish rough drafts.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_50.wav,283884,"Careful revision of the drafts helps in checking the development of the arguments in the report, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_51.wav,206444,representation of the material as well as the cohesiveness of the entire report. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_52.wav,275884,Preparation of the final bibliography- It is essential that from the very beginning 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_53.wav,197452,"of the research the researcher must maintain a blib… bibliography of the literature read, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_54.wav,249676,"consulted, and incorporated in the research process. This bibliography is generally appended "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_55.wav,223372,to the research project. It should be arranged alphabetically and be divided into various 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_56.wav,271084,"parts like names of the books, articles, reports, and legislations consulted. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_57.wav,215436,Another guideline that the researcher must follow is footnoting and headnotes. The researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_58.wav,266572,must wherever citing another author’s work make due footnotes or end notes to add authenticity 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_59.wav,222124,and reference to the report. There are various methods of writing bibliography and footnotes 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_60.wav,194284,like the Bluebook method which is basically from the Harvard School and the Oscola method 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_61.wav,107276,which is of the Oxford School.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_106.wav,201004,"Firstly, in the main body, there should be an introduction. The purpose of an introduction "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_107.wav,233644,"is to give a background so as to make clear to the readers why the problem, the research "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_108.wav,275564,problem here was considered worth investigating. Then the main body should contain the methodology. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_109.wav,187244,This represents the research design and method used in carrying out the research.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_110.wav,298604,"It should give exact meaning of the measurements or terms or variables used, selection of sampling, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_111.wav,149484,"universe selected tools of data collection, hypothesis, etcetera. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_112.wav,246764,"Next part of the main body is the review of literature. Here, the report writer assesses "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_113.wav,211564,the important and relevant already existing literature on the problem. The rationale of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_114.wav,193324,the review is to develop upon the conceptual framework in the background of the research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_115.wav,217964,which will become the source of formulation of the hypothesis subsequently. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_116.wav,204844,Next part of the main body is a analysis and interpretation. This is the most crucial part 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_117.wav,249644,"of the report. In it, the data which has been collected is processed, analyzed, and interpreted "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_118.wav,246444,and various generalizations and inferences are drawn. There must be clarity and continuity 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_119.wav,198124,in the presentation of the text and the result that follows in the main body. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_120.wav,176396,The next part of the main body of the report is the findings and recommendations.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_121.wav,246092,"Under findings and recommendations, a detailed presentation of the findings of the study with supporting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_122.wav,258604,data in the form of tables and charts together with the validation of result is the next 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_123.wav,125164,step in the writing of the main text of the report. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_124.wav,179884,This generally comprises the main body of the report extending over several chapters. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_125.wav,273004,"All relevant results must find a place in this report. Towards the end of the main text, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_126.wav,208684,"the researcher should aim to put down the research, the results of his research clearly "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_127.wav,206156,and precisely. He should state the implication that flow from the result of the study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_128.wav,124492,It should then state the recommendations. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_129.wav,231724,The next part of the main body of a legal research report is the conclusion or the summary. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_130.wav,169644,The main text of the report must end with a summary of the report or the conclusions 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_131.wav,97964,drawn from the findings. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_132.wav,253804,The final part is the references. References have appendices. Appendices should also be 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_133.wav,221484,"enlisted in respect of old technical data such as questionnaire, sample information, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_134.wav,241324,"mathematical derivations, and the like ones. A simple appendix should be headed, appendix "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_135.wav,225644,in bold and centered on the page in capitals without punctuation and three lines space 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_136.wav,258604,below the heading. Each appendix is numbered and stated on a new page. Appendices should 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_137.wav,227884,be listed in the table of content together with page numbers. Appendices may be placed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_138.wav,206444,between the final chapter and the bibliography or immediately after bibliography. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_139.wav,268844,At the end of a legal research report all the consulted sources of data whether preliminary 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_140.wav,240364,"or secondary, references, books, articles, reports, unpublished material, etcetera, must "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_141.wav,220524,be listed in a bibliography. The purpose of a bibliography is to provide cross-reference 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_142.wav,246412,as well as authenticity to the report. It should always be in an alphabetical order. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_143.wav,165516,Now the style of writing bibliography depends upon whether there is already a prescribed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_144.wav,198444,form as in the case of a dissertation or the thesis under a university or the researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_145.wav,223692,can adopt any style. Some of the common ones are the Bluebook which is the Harvard form 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_146.wav,204876,of citation and the Oscola which is the Oxford University prescribed citation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_147.wav,259212,Now let’s go on to see how to cite legal material. Now in case of an authored book 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_148.wav,215756,"by a single author, the citation must always be in this sequence, first the name of the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_149.wav,208012,"author, then the tile of the book, the page number, if referring to a specific page or "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_150.wav,226604,"pages and then the publisher, along with the publisher, the name of publication, the edition "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_151.wav,234956,or the year of publication. Here is an example of it like M.P.Jain’s Indian Constitutional 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_152.wav,124204,Law has been cited here. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_153.wav,238732,"Coming to citation made of a book written by two authors. Now in this, the sequence "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_154.wav,182764,"must be that the names of the authors are first mentioned, then the title of the book "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_155.wav,231436,"along with the page number, if referring to a specific page or pages, then the publisher, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_156.wav,264044,"name of publication, the edition, the year of publication. Here is an example of it. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_157.wav,152332,"Now what happens when the multiple authors, let’s say more than two authors book is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_158.wav,229836,"being cited, under it the use of term ‘at all.’ is used, the name of the first author "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_159.wav,198412,"is only mentioned and after his name the term ‘at all.’ is written, then the title of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_160.wav,168716,"the book, the page number if referring to a specific page or pages, and then the publisher, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_161.wav,248012,"place of publication, edition, year of publication. Here is an example of it. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_162.wav,275916,"Now, how to cite an edited book? When a book is edited by a single author then the name "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_163.wav,223084,"of the editor is mentioned first along with it in bracket ‘ed.’ is mentioned, then "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_164.wav,197804,"the title of the book, the page number if referring to a specific pages or page, then "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_165.wav,205804,"the publisher, the place of publication, the edition, and the year. Following is an example "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_166.wav,131244,of such an edited book being cited. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_167.wav,198092,"Coming to case laws – Now, how one cites a case law. In India, we have number of journals "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_168.wav,217356,which report cases in various courts in India. The citation of case laws vary accordingly. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_169.wav,224364,"However, the broad citation idea is firstly the name of the case is mentioned, then the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_170.wav,286444,"journal name, for example, AIR Supreme Court cases, then the volume number, the year, the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_171.wav,275212,"court, and the page number. Following is the example of a case cited in the AIR and in SCC.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_173.wav,281324,"Now, how do we cite an act? The act is written in a research report aft… in its full form. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_174.wav,132812,"That is for example, if we are citing the Competition Act two thousand two, then we "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_175.wav,182444,mention it as the Competition Act two thousand two along with the serial number of the year 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_176.wav,157484,in which it was enacted that is Act twelve of the year two thousand three. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_177.wav,260876,"Now, when we are citing a report then we mention the authority whose report it is, number of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_178.wav,203884,"report, name and the year of publication. Like here in the example we have cited a report "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_179.wav,187884,"of Law Commission, so we have written it as Law Commission of India, then the report number "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_180.wav,217004,which is one forty fourth report on conflicting judicial decisions pertaining to the code 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_181.wav,162572,"of civil procedure, the year, and the page number. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_182.wav,267884,"Now, how do we cite an article or an essay? In a report, an article or an essay published "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_183.wav,231724,"in a journal or a periodical is cited in such a form. First, the name of the author of the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_184.wav,280364,"article is mentioned, then the title of the essay within inverted commas, then volume "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_185.wav,221836,"number of the journal, then name of the journal in abbreviations and then finally the page "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_186.wav,302764,number and in the bracket the year of publication. Here is an example of this. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_187.wav,257644,Coming to citation of an editorial from a newspaper- How do we cite an editorial from a newspaper?  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_188.wav,220844,These are cited by firstly mentioning the title of the editorial within inverted 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_189.wav,210284,"comma, the name of the newspaper and the date. Now, here is an example we have written “Short-circuited” "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_190.wav,238732,"Times of India, August two is the date and the year of publication. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_191.wav,299884,"Now, how does one cite an unpublished work? For example, a thesis of a person, under it "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_192.wav,186636,"the citation is written in such a form that firstly the name of the researcher is written, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_193.wav,166764,then the title of dissertation or the thesis as the case may be along with the year in 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_194.wav,241324,"which the thi… the thesis was written, then the unpublished Ph.D. thesis needs to write "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_195.wav,185644,the name of the university or the organization. Following is an example of it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_196.wav,255692,"Now, how do we cite a website? If the website gives the information as to when it was last "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_197.wav,228524,modified then it must be cited. If not one must cite the date of the visiting of the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_198.wav,181836,"library. Here is the example of it, in case it has been modified then in the end of the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_199.wav,233932,citation in the bracket we write last modified on such and such date and in case it has not 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_200.wav,202636,been modified or it is not mentioned then in the bracket we write visited on the date. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_201.wav,256972,"Now, there are certain precautions that one has to keep in mind while writing a report. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_202.wav,243244,"Following are these, first is the length of a report. The length of a report varies depending "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_203.wav,233004,"on the nature and type of report. However, the researcher must keep in mind that the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_204.wav,223468,"report must not be too long otherwise the researcher, the readers of the research may "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_205.wav,74252,lose interest in it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_206.wav,145644,Second precaution that one should keep in mind while writing the report is that the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_207.wav,254764,report must be interesting and engaging. The style and language of the report must be simple 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_208.wav,177004,yet able to maintain the interest of the readers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_209.wav,252524,"Next precaution is the diagrammatic representation. The researcher must add graphs, charts, tables "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_210.wav,300812,or the various findings so that reader is able to quickly discern them. Another precaution 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_211.wav,185356,that must be kept in mind by the researcher while writing a report is preplanning of the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_212.wav,212204,report. Keep the objectives of the research in mind. The researcher must preplan the layout 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_213.wav,198412,"and the structure of the report for it to be in accordance with the nature, scope, and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_214.wav,55436,finding of the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_215.wav,267532,"Next, it should be grammatically sound. The report must be free from grammatical and punctuational "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_216.wav,302124,"errors. All footnotes, abbreviations, etcetera, must be clearly mentioned. The sixth precaution "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_217.wav,194636,that one should bear in mind while writing a report is maintaining logical flow throughout 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_218.wav,220204,the report. It is necessary for the clarity and better communication of the report that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_219.wav,199084,there must be logical flow of the subject matter in the report without which it will 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_220.wav,128364,be difficult for the readers to decipher it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_221.wav,184332,Another precaution that must always be kept in mind by the researcher is that the report 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_222.wav,265324,must be under all cost original. Every report must strive to be as original in its research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_223.wav,209676,"findings, styles of presentation, and knowledge building. This contributes greatly to the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_224.wav,148524,future legal research work in the same field. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_225.wav,199084,Another precaution that is to be kept in mind is mentioned further implications of the report. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_226.wav,204844,"Towards the end of the report, the researcher must mention the further implications of the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_227.wav,283884,"said work like in the policy implementation or let’s say jurisprudential contribution, etcetera. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_228.wav,197772,Another important precaution to be kept in mind at the time of writing a report is bibliography 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_229.wav,287404,must be comprehensive. Exhaustive bibliography must be mentioned at the end of the report. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_230.wav,182156,"Another objective, another precaution that must be kept in mind while writing a report "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_231.wav,215724,"is the objectives, nature, technique, and limitations be stated. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_16_Report_writing_232.wav,181164,"In the introduction part of the report, the researcher must mention the objectives, scope, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_54.wav,178924,Each case study is description of specific configuration events in which a particular 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_55.wav,211244,set of actors have been involved in some defined situation at a particular point of time. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_56.wav,195276,"In setting out a case study, the analyst must decide in advance at what point to enter the "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_58.wav,228492,It should emphasize on the theoretical connection between the events rather than the events themselves. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_59.wav,185996,Any technique can be used for the collection of data and it is preferably to operate with  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_60.wav,179884,"Since, data beyond what is strictly germane to this purpose are redundant. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_61.wav,185644,"Thus, a case study method is a very important method and it has been used by physician and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_62.wav,121324,psychologists for many years to examine their cases.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_65.wav,160972,There has been a debate on case study method whether it should be used or not. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_66.wav,170316,"So, there have been various arguments regarding the use of case study as a method or technique "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_67.wav,55084,of data collection. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_68.wav,110124,Some thinkers argue against the use of case study as a method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_69.wav,252204,"According to them a case study method gives a narrow account of the individual, family, situation or event. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_70.wav,168332,The other set of thinkers are in favor of using case study as a method or technique 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_71.wav,195276,"as it gives a holistic understanding of the individual family, situation or event. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_72.wav,200652,"To avoid such an argument a researcher can use case study as a method, adding gender "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_74.wav,215724,This way he or she can synergise the two perspective and conduct a holistic research of the issue. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_75.wav,196556,"For example, a statistical survey might give the information on the quantity of d… of "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_78.wav,161004,Another important thing about the case study is that it might introduce new and unexpected 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_79.wav,183404,results during its course and just not prove or disprove hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_80.wav,244812,This aspect is important as it leads the researcher  to a new direction and paves way for many new researches.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_83.wav,243596,The case study method makes research more interesting than a purely statistical research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_84.wav,166412,"Once we have understood the arguments that have taken against and for for the case study, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_85.wav,113004,let's also understand some characteristics of the case study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_86.wav,183756,"The very first characteristic of the case study is, it is narrowly focused. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_87.wav,177324,Mostly a case study offers a description of only a single individual and sometimes about 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_88.wav,215724,groups and often the case study focuses on a limited aspect of a person such as the psychological 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_89.wav,84844,symptoms or their experience. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_90.wav,128364,"Secondly, it combines objective and subjective data. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_91.wav,161964,"This is the most important characteristic of case studies, because the researcher may "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_92.wav,194924,"combine objective and subjective data and all the data regarded as valid data for analyst, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_93.wav,147532,analysis and as a basis for inferences within the case study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_94.wav,214796,He or she can combine the objective description of behavior and its con… context and details 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_95.wav,172524,"of the subjective aspects such as feelings, belief, impressions or interpretation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_96.wav,205452,"In fact, case study is uniquely able to offer a means of achieving an in-depth understanding "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_97.wav,143404,of the behavior and experience of a single individual. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_98.wav,84876,"Thirdly, it is a descriptive study. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_99.wav,117132,"The data collected describes the person, group, or family. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_100.wav,195596,The main emphasis always on the construction of verbal description of behavior or experience. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_101.wav,91532,But quantitative data may be collected. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_102.wav,191436,"In doing so, a high level of details is provided, it is an in-depth understanding of the behavior "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_103.wav,93772,and experience of a single individual. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_104.wav,94476,"Finally, it is a process oriented. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_105.wav,187532,"The case study method enables the researcher to explore and describe the nature of processes, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_106.wav,251564,which occur over time in contrast to the experimental method which basically provides a still snapshot 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_107.wav,186956,"of processes, which may be continuing over time, like for example, the development of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_108.wav,98284,language in children over time. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_109.wav,188492,"After understanding the characteristics, let's also define the d… various types of case studies. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_110.wav,116204,"According to Yin and Winston, there are three types of case studies. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_111.wav,199756,"First is exploratory – In exploratory case studies, fieldwork that is data collection "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_112.wav,125164,may be undertaken before defining research question. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_113.wav,191404,This type of a study may be seen as a prelude to a larger social scientific study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_114.wav,134092,Second type of case study is called us explanatory case study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_115.wav,203596,This type of study seeks to explain certain phenomena and is used when conducting studies 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_116.wav,159724,particularly in complex studies of organizations or communities. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_117.wav,129644,The third aspect is called as descriptive case studies. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_118.wav,216364,"This type of study requires the investigator to present a descriptive theory, which establish "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_119.wav,154604,the overall framework for the investigator to follow throughout the study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_120.wav,243244,"Before beginning research, the investigator must determine exactly what the unit of analysis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_121.wav,68204,in this study will be. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_122.wav,222444,When we are designing study we have to keep few points in mind because it is the most important thing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_123.wav,179884,"It is very easy to conduct a case study, but it is very difficult to design a case study. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_124.wav,220812,"So, to design a case study one should keep in mind the subject and the relevance of the subject. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_125.wav,172556,The first step is to isolate the group or person whom you are trying to study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_126.wav,148204,"For example, statistical analysis show that the sex ratio has declined in India. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_127.wav,216076,A case study of one or two states will help the researcher in determining the social and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_128.wav,111692,economic reasons responsible for it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_129.wav,207372,"Secondly, it is important to plan and design the way you are going to address this study "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_130.wav,121676,and to ensure that the data collected is relevant. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_131.wav,169324,Researcher has to keep in mind that study is focused and concise. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_132.wav,215372,The researcher should carry a list of points that he or she is going to try and address 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_133.wav,62124,during this study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_134.wav,196556,It will help him or her in ensuring that all research is done around these points. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_135.wav,229804,"Finally, it is important for the researcher to be passive during his or her research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_136.wav,217612,"He or she has to act like an observer, then an experimenter as it will give the researcher "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_137.wav,73356,more information on the issue. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_138.wav,231724,"How do we, once we have designed the case study how do we analyze a case study? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_139.wav,181484,The most interesting part about case study is its analysis as it is more opinion based 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_140.wav,58924,then statistical method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_141.wav,210284,The data is gathered into manageable form and a narrative is constructed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_142.wav,180492,To make the results more interesting try to use examples in narratives. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_143.wav,213804,While analyzing the statistical data can also be of use but that should not give all the

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_145.wav,232684,The aim of the researcher is n… only trying to judge trends and not analyze every piece of data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_146.wav,257324,The analysis should be produced in such a way that a layman also should be able to understand it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_147.wav,209292,"A case study is designed to provoke reason debate, and there is no right or wrong answer "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_148.wav,60204,in the case study.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_150.wav,91532,for any research and the researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_151.wav,190508,The case study method with its use of multiple data collection method and analysis technique 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_152.wav,154252,provides researcher with the opportunity to triangulate data in order to strengthen the

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_156.wav,203916,Researchers use the quantitative data that has been collected to corroborate and support 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_157.wav,219884,the qualitative data which is most useful for understanding the rationale or theory

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_159.wav,216684,Another technique is to use multiple investigator to gain the advantage provided when a variety

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_205.wav,145964,"And so, some type of reliability measures are very low. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_225.wav,196844,"To understand the case study method, let's take an example of a case study method from the field of law. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_226.wav,266604,"There is a beautiful example given by Epstein, which has been mentioned in IGNOU notes on Research Methodology. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_227.wav,217644,"It goes like this, “While explaining the application of case study method in the field "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_228.wav,230124,"of law, Epstein treated law as a problem with which all human groups would appear to be "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_231.wav,106924,ways may serve to illuminate these problems.” 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_232.wav,203564,"The discussion has concentrated on law as a body of rules, as a set of procedure of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_233.wav,171564,"enquiry and adjudication, and as an instrument of social control. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_234.wav,292204,Epstein makes a further point about law that it may also be regarded as embodying a system of values. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_235.wav,181804,"Moreover, as a social institution, it is, it it is, itself subject to evaluation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_236.wav,237164,We are concerned here with the basic assumption or postulate that underlying the social life 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_237.wav,216332,of a community and the ways in which the task and purpose of law may be perceived. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_238.wav,184716,"To conclude, the case study method is an important technique of data collection. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_239.wav,178284,This method provides detailed descriptive data which is usually qualitative in nature. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_240.wav,181452,"It is also a complex method as sometime it produces large amount of data, which the researcher "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_241.wav,77836,is not able to handle. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_28_Case_study_242.wav,141804,"Many disciplines use this method to build upon theory, to produce new theory, to dispute "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_6.wav,201004,The comparative ability of the individual or the group in the question may be expressed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_7.wav,95404,in percentage terms by rater. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_8.wav,178604,"For instance, Mr. A is more competent than ten percent of the teacher. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_9.wav,223052,The rater must have a clear knowledge of the ability of the given group or individuals. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_10.wav,172556,Precautions and Limitations for Rating Scales - It is difficult and sometime dangerous to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_11.wav,274924,"fix up rating about many aspects of an individual or overall aspect of, from only one or two known qualities. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_12.wav,173164,There may be some “halo-effect” in the judgement which should be carefully guarded against.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_13.wav,177612,The raters may overestimate the qualities of a known person and underestimate those 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_14.wav,65004,of unknown person. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_15.wav,149196,The rater very often do not want to make extreme judgements. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_16.wav,217324,"In the absence of objective standards or definitions different rates, raters may give judgements "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_17.wav,82604,on the basis of subjective evaluation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_18.wav,130924,"Thus, this scale becomes unscientific and unreliable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_19.wav,186924,The raters themselves must be unbiased and trained. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_20.wav,179244,Then the specification of the reference group and the definition of the attributes being 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_21.wav,78092,measured must be objective and clear. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_22.wav,254764,In the case of judgements of complex attributes it is better to use less differentiated scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_23.wav,198444,Several raters giving independent judgment can work as a team and can be very helpful 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_24.wav,189196,"in increasing the reliability of ratings, particularly when these are made during the "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_28.wav,177356,Rank Order Scale - There is another method of scaling called Rank Order Scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_29.wav,159724,Rank Order Scale is another method of comparative and relative rating. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_30.wav,193644,"In this method, the judge is required to rank individuals in relation to one another. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_31.wav,203564,"When the population is very limited, the judge has to prepare a rank order of individual "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_32.wav,113324,from higher in the scale to the lowest. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_33.wav,168364,In a rating scale the individual rater himself may be subject of rating. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_34.wav,90924,This is known as self-rating. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_35.wav,96332,Self-rating has its own advantage and limitations. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_36.wav,218316,"However, self-rating has been found to be useful in measuring the attitudes like intensity, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_38.wav,84204,The following two methods may be illustrative. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_39.wav,150124,Paired Comparison - This is a simple method of ranking scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_40.wav,196524,In this type of scale two stimuli are presented before the judges out of which the better 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_41.wav,50924,one is to be selected. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_42.wav,104684,The continuum is properly defined. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_43.wav,185004,"The ranks are different types of jobs, for instance, suitable for ladies can be determined. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_44.wav,143404,The investigators can make several pairs of job available. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_45.wav,181772,"The respondents may be asked to point out which of the jobs, two jobs he or she likes. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_46.wav,210316,After all the pairs have been considered any possible inconsistency may be located. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_47.wav,251852,"For instance, if job two is preferred to job three and job three is preferred to job four, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_48.wav,181836,"then by the transitivity axiom, job two is preferred to job four. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_49.wav,229484,"If somebody prefers in this connection job four to job three, his behaviour is inconsistent "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_50.wav,132204,and the inconsistent result may be eliminated. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_51.wav,191404,"In this method, the number of preferences of all persons for a particular job is added "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_52.wav,145964,and is divided by the number of people who are giving the preferences. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_53.wav,137644,The result that is obtained becomes who are giving the preferences. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_54.wav,195564,The result that is obtained becomes the scale value for the particular job. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_55.wav,193324,"On this basis, score values are ascertained, the scale value is explained numerically. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_56.wav,90924,This method is only a rough and simple method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_57.wav,201964,"It can, however, be made more meaningful by constructing the paired comparison mat… "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_58.wav,173484,"matrix, as has been done by Gutlford in his Psychometric Method. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_59.wav,231404,Next is called the Horowitz Method - Horowitz Method applied a ranking scale for testing racial prejudices. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_60.wav,164204,He took eight pictures of Negroes and four pictures of white children. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_61.wav,195244,These twelve pictures were shown to the school children who were asked to indicate their preferences.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_62.wav,195564,"First preference was indicated by the number one, second by two, third by three and so on. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_63.wav,186604,"Then, separately the scores for the whites and for the Negroes were added and compare. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_64.wav,166444,"In this way, it was possible to know the attitude towards Negroes and whites. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_65.wav,170924,"Needless to say, the smaller the score the greater is the preference. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_66.wav,181164,If all the white children are given the first four preferences the total score would be

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_127.wav,128364,The procedures involved five steps. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_128.wav,239724,First is composing a large number of statements by the researcher concerning the attitudes to be measured.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_132.wav,144684,Each statement is written on a separate piece of paper. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_133.wav,148844,Ranking items by a number of judges to order them on a continuum.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_136.wav,142124,This is called giving a scale value to statement into a number of categories. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_137.wav,266892,According to how favourable or unfavourable the items are to the attitude being investigated. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_138.wav,217996,Each judges rank each item according to the favourable of the items to the attitude usually

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_211.wav,247084,Teachers remain as physically and mentally fit at sixty five age as at sixty years.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_213.wav,210604,"So, instead of raising the age of retirement, old teacher should be given fellowship for "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_223.wav,202604,By adding up the different scores of an individual his total score is calculated that is summation 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_224.wav,99884,of different scores for different statements. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_225.wav,130284,The researcher should identify the items which have a higher discriminatory power. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_226.wav,223724,The responses are interpreted to determine which of the statements discriminate very 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_227.wav,151084,clearly between high score and the low score on the total scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_228.wav,124204,It has to be measured that the questionnaire is consistent.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_232.wav,136684,The Likert-type scale has the following main advantages over the Thrustone scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_233.wav,134764,The method of construction of Likert-type scale is less cumbersome. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_234.wav,167404,"It is, it supplies more precisely and definite response towards the issue. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_235.wav,125804,The intermediate vague points are absent in the scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_236.wav,193964,"The Likert scale permits the relevance of several five degree agreement or disagreement, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_237.wav,230444,but Thrustone Scale is based on only two alternative responses that is acceptance or rejection. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_238.wav,144044,Likert-type scale is more informative and reliable than the Thrustone Scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_239.wav,208364,In a Likert-type scale any items or statement empirically consistent with the statement 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_240.wav,58604,may be included. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_241.wav,141804,"Thrustone Scale, only the strictly related items are included. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_242.wav,201004,"Thus, Likert-type scale has a border area of reference and has also method of checking "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_243.wav,172492,internal consistency which is conspicuous by its absence in Thrustone Scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_244.wav,135436,"However, the Likert-type scale is not free from defects. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_245.wav,153964,The judgement on the basis of total score which is estimated by calculating the mean 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_246.wav,88684,or median is not scientific. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_247.wav,215084,"The total score value maybe the same in many cases, but the attitude may be different towards an issue. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_248.wav,172204,"The score on the Likert-type scale may be helpful for making an ordering of the people, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_249.wav,194604,but such an ordering will not have any scientific and objective basis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_250.wav,174444,Another defect of the scale is that there is no objective basis for expressing different 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_251.wav,81644,degrees of agreement or disagreement. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_252.wav,213804,"However, despite some limitation it remains an important ordinal scale. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_265.wav,131564,The cumulative type of scale was successfully used by Borgardus first. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_266.wav,105324,"Thus, it is also known as Borgardus Scale. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_267.wav,162604,The main purpose of the social distance scale or Bogardus Scale is to measure the attitude 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_268.wav,44204,towards a particular racial group or groups.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_275.wav,95404,The Bogardus-type scale is can be shown.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_296.wav,155276,The seven categories indicate a gradual increasing social distance. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_297.wav,156812,The fact that the specified items in Bogardus Scale form a cumulative scale is empirically 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_298.wav,73996,borne out in many countries. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_299.wav,161004,"However, some practical reversal may be noticed on a social distance scale. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_300.wav,187884,"For instance, a group may not be liked as neighbour, but may be liked as a friend in a club. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_301.wav,194924,But these reversals are more possible in individual cases rather than for the group as a whole. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_302.wav,193964,The reversal have been found in to be mostly due to the influence of the external factors. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_303.wav,161324,"In the Bogardus-type scale, the respondent has to indicate his first feeling. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_306.wav,162604,The social distance can also be calculated mathematically. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_307.wav,149132,"In order to do this, weights are attached to different categories of relationship. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_309.wav,71116,can be assigned to the first five categories respectively. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_310.wav,168044,The following procedure is generally adopted for the measurement of social distance.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_339.wav,184716,A perfectly cumulative or unidimensional scale is hardly possible in social research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_340.wav,200684,Scalogram analysis is a simple method of testing the scalability of the statement. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_341.wav,125164,The view of judges are not necessary in this case. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_342.wav,170604,A diagram in which individual responses are laid out is called a Scalogram. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_343.wav,175724,"In the Guttman technique, the perfect scale implies that a person who answers a given "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_344.wav,215404,question favourably will have a higher total score than a person who answers it unfavourably. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_345.wav,201324,The Guttman scale is analytically complex apart from the fact that there is no guarantee 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_346.wav,201324,that the various items will scale and even if they do the universe of the content may 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_347.wav,69804,remain narrow in coverage. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_348.wav,166764,This method is more appropriate for scaling ordered behaviour than less structured and

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_350.wav,118764,Guttman model is deterministic in nature. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_351.wav,232652,It assumes that a person who response positively or negatively to one item must respond positively 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_352.wav,82316,or negatively to a series of others. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_353.wav,145004,The model can be made probabilistic rather than deterministic. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_354.wav,178924,This attempt has been made by “Latent Structure Analyst” as developed by Lazarsfeld. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_355.wav,118764,Guttman has developed another technique. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_356.wav,147532,"According to this, the respondent not only give his view, agreement or disagreement, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_357.wav,197196,but he also mentions the intensity or degree which is classified into five categories. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_358.wav,202892,"First, for each respondent we must get two scores that is content score and intensity "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_359.wav,126796,score which can be plotted against each other on a graph. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_360.wav,76844,The result often gives a U-shaped curve. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_361.wav,117484,The more extreme views have highest intensity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_362.wav,181804,The content some at the lowest point of the universe may be regarded as the dividing line 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_363.wav,89644,between favourable and unfavourable responses. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_364.wav,100844,The lowest point suggesting favourable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_23_Scaling_2_365.wav,296364,"So, this is how he developed another technique which is also very useful in understanding the Guttman scale. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_0.wav,42252,Hello everyone. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_1.wav,32044,Welcome back. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_2.wav,32044,How are you doing? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_3.wav,95116,We are back on a new topic called Survey Method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_4.wav,85804,"If you remember, I am Dr. Ritu Sharma. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_5.wav,73964,We have discussed many topics before. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_6.wav,107532,"And today, I am going to discuss a new topic called Survey Method. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_7.wav,210636,Survey Method is a very simple and common technique of data collection or research methodology. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_8.wav,242252,So the learning objective in this module would be to understand this concept of Survey Methods 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_9.wav,167756,"and then to see how many types of Survey Methods are there, what is the history behind it and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_10.wav,110444,what kind of steps have been taken in conducting a survey. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_11.wav,156204,Then there are various data collection techniques as well which are part of survey. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_12.wav,175404,"And finally, we are going to understand the advantages and disadvantages of this survey method. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_13.wav,107244,So let us start with the concept of Survey Method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_14.wav,185644,"There are a lot of ways of conducting a research and collecting information, but one of the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_15.wav,86124,best ways I can tell you is the Survey Method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_16.wav,231084,A survey is defined as a brief interview or discussion with individuals about a specific topic. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_17.wav,147244,"The term survey is unfortunately a little vague, so we need to define it better. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_18.wav,117484,The term survey is often used to mean ‘collect information’. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_19.wav,250604,"For instance, you might imagine a researcher or television scientist saying that we need to do a survey. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_20.wav,163884,"So, besides a definition above, survey also means to collect information. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_21.wav,193964,We have our first definition of a brief interview and we have a second definition of collecting data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_22.wav,183404,The survey method is the technique of gathering data by asking questions to people who are 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_23.wav,59564,thought to have desired information. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_24.wav,100844,A formal list of questionnaire is prepared. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_25.wav,134764,"Generally, a non-disguised approach is used. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_26.wav,149164,The respondents are asked questions on their demographic interest opinion. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_27.wav,132844,There is a difference between survey and a survey research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_28.wav,170924,Survey research is popularly identified by opinion polls and market research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_29.wav,173484,"Whereas surveys, on the other hand, are also a defining feature of sociological research "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_30.wav,90924,and they form a part of anthropological inquiry too. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_31.wav,258604,A numerical survey of some kind at some stage of social science research is quite a usual practice. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_32.wav,172524,"Often, the researchers map the physical universe before interpreting the universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_33.wav,215084,They establish the typicality of what has been reported or observed and judge the authenticity 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_34.wav,105644,of correlation made during the course of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_35.wav,186924,The reason for favoring the survey method and other quantitative technique is that survey 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_36.wav,241964,provides researcher a way to manage obtaining the data from large and complex societies. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_37.wav,190124,"Those studying social issues pertaining to urban areas, for example, the subject of migration "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_38.wav,267564,of rural population to industrial cities would carry out large scale social surveys of migration patterns. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_39.wav,189484,They would use questionnaire as a research tool and process their data on computers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_40.wav,129324,The usefulness of survey is judged in the context of their purpose. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_41.wav,245164,"Generally, surveys serve the purpose of counting and classifying sets of events, opinions or other forms. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_42.wav,184972,Quantification is involved in surveys which lends more reliability and accuracy to a large 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_43.wav,57356,quantity of information. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_44.wav,188844,You can measure the usefulness of a survey in terms of objectiveness of your research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_45.wav,183372,We need to remember that you cannot gather all types of information by one method alone. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_46.wav,195916,"Further, different methods, for example, direct face-to-face questioning, inferring by observation "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_47.wav,238444,and counting heads through surveys offer different outcomes and quite often complement each other 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_48.wav,146252,to provide a more integrated set of data for interpretation and analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_49.wav,207084,Mitchell observed that quantitative methods are subordinate to qualitative research and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_50.wav,207084,obtaining quantified data is only a means to reaching the understanding that is not 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_51.wav,80716,possible for statistics to capture. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_52.wav,171212,All the same there has been a growing engagement in quantitative method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_53.wav,230796,"As pointed out by Ellen, we need to make a distinction between what one is able to survey "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_54.wav,176972,and collect as facts and survey of facts as reported by respondents. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_55.wav,191436,The first is a simple counting of items and the second is a counting of statement about items. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_56.wav,204812,"As opinions of respondents also are social fact, it is important to take note of them. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_57.wav,222124,Placing such data the data the social context that taking the account of other kinds of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_58.wav,234924,"data, one can expect to achieve the objectives of obtaining scientifically reliable and accurate "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_59.wav,120396,information for further interpretation and analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_60.wav,218572,"By other kinds of data, we mean “hard facts” provided, for example, by census material "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_61.wav,48396,and government surveys. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_62.wav,169612,"In all surveys, we need to look carefully at the way of information gathering as well "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_63.wav,102476,as the way of its interpretation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_64.wav,173164,Most useful surveys employ the strategy of first knowing the field from the close quarters 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_65.wav,170924,through intensive fieldwork that offers the opportunity of close contact with people. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_66.wav,167692,Only then it becomes possible to frame relevant questions to go in the questionnaire. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_67.wav,170636,"For getting the respondents to cooperate in filling the questionnaire, it is important "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_69.wav,204844,"So, social science research techniques are often classified into two categories, namely "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_70.wav,48044,quantitative and qualitative. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_71.wav,133836,Qualitative research enables us to understand the subtle aspects of social relations. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_72.wav,209004,"They are particularly useful when one is interested in probing a specific question in depth, its "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_74.wav,109516,"However, qualitative method also have their limitation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_75.wav,180492,"They are, for example, most suitable when research is being carried out in a small setting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_76.wav,129036,or in a focused or a specific group or community. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_77.wav,204524,"Qualitative research methods are not very useful when we need to know about macro phenomena, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_78.wav,247084,"such as the demographic structure of a population or the extent and nature of poverty, disease. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_79.wav,233964,Quantitative method or survey research enables us to study these questions in a more comprehensive manner. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_80.wav,198412,"Depending upon the requirement, survey research can be extended to a large an area of population "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_93.wav,123276,Let us go back to the history of the survey method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_94.wav,177932,"Though systematically carried out surveys have a short history, rulers in the past have "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_95.wav,201964,always been interested in finding out what was going on in their states and the conditions of their subjects. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_96.wav,173196,"There are umpteen stories of rulers or their representatives going to meet the public, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_125.wav,88044,It also helps in measuring the change. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_126.wav,143724,It not only studies the attitude but also the behavior and habits of the people. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_127.wav,75564,It examines the cause and effect relationship. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_128.wav,183724,"It studies the characteristics of a phenomena, formulates a hypothesis, tests a hypothesis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_129.wav,57004,and then helps in decision making. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_130.wav,238444,Sample surveys are conducted in order to provide the researcher or the sponsor of the researcher

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_133.wav,104684,between them to establish pattern of cause and effect. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_134.wav,185964,"For instance, in a study of industrial relations, we might compare different workplace in terms "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_135.wav,285804,of a number of variables that that we hypothesize are likely to be associated with the industrial dissent.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_136.wav,195564,"This might be the size of the firm or organization, the type of industry, the inclusiveness of "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_140.wav,189484,To analyze such relationship and draw widespread conclusion requires the researcher to generate 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_141.wav,237804,large amount of data so that conclusions can be generalized from the sample surveys to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_142.wav,129324,the wider population from which the survey respondents were drawn. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_143.wav,169004,In order to have confidence in the results generated from a sample survey and to eliminate 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_144.wav,211564,"or minimise bias, the researcher should aim to maximize the response rate and in doing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_145.wav,186604,so ensure that the study is representative of the population group. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_146.wav,103084,Now let us understand the various types of surveys. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_147.wav,87404,The first one is the Descriptive Survey. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_148.wav,193644,A descriptive survey attempts to picture or document current conditions or attitude that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_149.wav,89644,is to describe what exists at the moment. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_150.wav,217644,Examples are Audience survey to determine the program program taste. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_151.wav,182124,"To study the changes, values, lifestyles and the effect of some special type of program. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_152.wav,44844,"Then, there is Analytical survey. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_153.wav,227564,An analytical survey attempts to describe and explain why certain situation exist. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_154.wav,212204,There we examine two or more variable to test or research hypothesis.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_158.wav,162284,"Then, opinion surveys where respondents express his views, point of opinion. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_159.wav,145964,Then there are interpretative surveys where the interpretations are done. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_160.wav,78124,"For example, why do you read newspaper? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_161.wav,114284,"Then, there are steps in the process of survey. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_162.wav,209324,"The very first step is the Research Step and the in research step we develop hypothesis, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_163.wav,189164,"we decide on type of surveys like whether it is going to be mail, interview, telephone, etcetera. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_164.wav,154284,"Write survey questionnaires, decide on response category and design the layout. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_165.wav,136364,"Then, there is the step two, that is plan how to record the data. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_166.wav,94764,"In this, we will pilot test survey instrument. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_167.wav,67564,We will revise the instrument. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_168.wav,144684,And then there will be third step that is deciding on the target population under which 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_169.wav,199724,"we will get the sample frame, decide on sampling size and sele… select a sample. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_170.wav,273324,"Then, we enter the data into computer where we will be rechecking all the data, perform statistical analysis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_171.wav,181804,"Then, we have the step four, where we will locate the respondents, conduct interviews, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_172.wav,46124,carefully record the data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_173.wav,203884,"And after that, we enter into the, data into the computers, recheck all the datas, perform "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_174.wav,102444,statistical analysis of the data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_175.wav,111404,Step six would be describing methods and findings in research reports. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_176.wav,191084,We will be presenting findings to others for critique and evaluation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_177.wav,165484,Sample surveys are a method of gathering information by means of personal interviews or questionnaire. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_178.wav,166124,They are sometimes referred to as ‘mass interviews’ because they are a way of collecting

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_220.wav,150124,They are often referred to as classification questions.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_222.wav,188524,up the possibility of describing and explaining complexities of social phenomena. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_223.wav,127084,A very important part of survey is sampling method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_224.wav,84204,Sampling has been dealt as a separate module. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_225.wav,148844,Here we will have a basic idea of sampling in survey. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_226.wav,193004,Sampling is a method that identifies a representative number from a given universe population. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_227.wav,114924,There are two basic properties of a sample. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_228.wav,49932,One is it should be adequate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_229.wav,190156,"The second is it should be representative of the universe, that is the entire population. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_230.wav,207724,The most crucial point on a sampling is to make sure that one's personal values do not 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_231.wav,72364,influence the selection procedure. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_232.wav,171884,"In order to keep out the researcher’s bias, various techniques or procedure of seeking "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_233.wav,91212,a sample have been suggested. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_234.wav,171244,Then let us understand the various methods of data collection under the survey method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_235.wav,144044,There are four main types of the data collection method for a social survey. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_236.wav,224044,The face-to-face interview where the respondent is questioned in person by an in… interviewer.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_238.wav,69804,relatively high response rate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_239.wav,179212,"However, such interviews commonly incurs high cost due to the number of interviews that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_240.wav,187916,"need to be employed, and it is also argued that the personal interaction between the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_241.wav,129644,interviewer and the res… respondent can lead to a biased responses. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_242.wav,166092,"In a study that considers questions of child discipline and punishment, it may be that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_243.wav,216364,"respondent will offer the socially acceptable responses, the answer and the answers that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_244.wav,77196,they believe the interviewer wants to hear. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_245.wav,197772,Postal questionnaires are widely used because they are relatively cheaper to administer 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_246.wav,105324,and they enable coverage of a wide geographical area. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_247.wav,177356,"Also, given that they avoid direct personal contact, they have the advantage at ensuring "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_248.wav,89004,a degree of privacy for the respondent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_249.wav,166764,The main disadvantage associated with postal questionnaire is that they that they perform 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_250.wav,91212,poorly in relation to response rate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_251.wav,101196,Telephonic interviews is the another technique. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_252.wav,260204,They have become more common in the past decades as technological advances have allowed researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_253.wav,46092,to draw sample with greater accuracy. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_254.wav,100844,They are also very quickly quick to administer. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_255.wav,208044,"However, they are limited to researchers who have access to the relevant technology such "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_257.wav,187884,Online surveys which are delivered by email or make use of web based form in place of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_258.wav,79084,a questionnaire are now widely used. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_259.wav,161612,"They share some of the characteristics of the postal surveys, in that they are inexpensive "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_260.wav,205164,"to administer, but they may have lower response rate than interviewer administrating the surveys. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_261.wav,232044,"Access to data, the instant responses is sent and being able to draw sample on a global "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_262.wav,177676,"scale are also attractive benefits, but the difference between the characteristics at "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_263.wav,242252,internet users and non-user can result in Internet-based samples which are not representative 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_264.wav,53836,at the general population. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_265.wav,222412,"Once the data have been collected, the researcher have to codify and proc… process the data "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_267.wav,174092,It should also become accessible for use of statistical treatment that would tell us about 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_268.wav,104364,the different qualities of the data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_269.wav,163244,Each of these methods of data collection has its own strengths and weaknesses in relation 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_270.wav,209004,"to design, cost, and so on, and in crude terms one`s weaknesses are often the other’s strength. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_271.wav,164524,"The method that is selected will depend on the type of population you aim to research, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_272.wav,175724,the nature of the research question and the resources at your disposal.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_289.wav,130572,We can choose different ways of administering surveys. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_290.wav,157196,From face-to-face interview to telephone and e-mails one can use any mode of collection 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_291.wav,119404,of data depending on one’s requirement and limitations. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_292.wav,184364,"Unlike the qualitative methods, survey method is carried out through standardized questions, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_293.wav,224044,which make measures more precise by enforcing uniform definition upon the participants. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_294.wav,191052,Standardizations ensure that similar kind of data are collected from groups and then

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_296.wav,107596,We have discussed the advantages of survey method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_297.wav,114604,Let’s now also look at the disadvantages of this method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_298.wav,191372,The first disadvantage is unwillingness of respondent to provide information. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_299.wav,118476,This requires salesmanship on the part of the interviewer. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_300.wav,194604,The interviewers may assure that the information will be kept secret or apply the technique 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_301.wav,65292,of offering some presence. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_302.wav,129324,Inability of the respondent to provide information. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_303.wav,210604,"This may be due to lack of knowledge, lapse of memory, inability to identify their motives "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_304.wav,87436,"and provide reason, why? for their actions. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_305.wav,108204,Human bias of the respondents are there. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_306.wav,61772,"For example, “Ego”. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_307.wav,59244,Symantec difficulties are there. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_308.wav,176684,It is difficult if not impossible to state a given question in such a way that it will 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_309.wav,77196,mean exactly same thing to each respondent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_310.wav,221164,"Similarly, two different wordings of the same question will frequently produce quite different results. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_311.wav,188204,A preoccupation with standardization result in designing questions in every general term 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_312.wav,134092,to make them minimally appropriate for all respondent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_313.wav,163564,This could lead to simplification and one may end up missing what may be most appropriate 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_314.wav,59564,to many respondent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_315.wav,217676,Survey research is inflexible in the sense that it requires a precise study design. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_316.wav,225964,"Everything must be worked out in advance, the tools to be used and the method of administering the tools. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_322.wav,131564,"In such a situation, carrying out a survey becomes very difficult. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_323.wav,173516,"Surveys also demand a great deal of attention and honesty on the part of the respondent, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_324.wav,197452,particularly when a questionnaire is being used and the survey is self-administered. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_325.wav,180556,Respondents may not always be willing to give such attention to filling the questionnaire. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_326.wav,215372,"Sometimes, it may be hard for participant to recall certain information or to take clear "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_26_Survey_Method_328.wav,163564,Another problem with the survey research is that it is invariably context-blind.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_44.wav,173132,Computer based data processing is further classified in two categories – first one 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_45.wav,164524,is offline data processing and another one is online data processing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_46.wav,268556,So let's discuss historical aspects of SPSS. The software was released in its first version 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_47.wav,141772,in nineteen sixty eight as the statistical package for the social science. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_49.wav,192396,one company with the name of SPSS Incorporation. in nineteen seventy five. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_50.wav,235532,Early ver… version of SPSS statistics were designed for batch processing on main frames 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_51.wav,280044,"computers, including for example IBM and ICL versions, originally using punch card for input. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_54.wav,66284,a previous version. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_55.wav,252844,"SPSS Statistics version sixteen point zero and later one under Windows, Mac and Linux, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_56.wav,267884,the graphical user interface is written in Java and the Mac OS version is provided by 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_57.wav,270796,a university binary mak… making it full compatible with both Power PC and Intel-based Mac hardware.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_59.wav,79724,Mac OS X and Unix. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_60.wav,248972,The Window version was updated frequently and had more feature than the version for 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_61.wav,48044,the other operating system. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_62.wav,274604,"SPSS was taken over by IBM Incorporation in January, two thousand nine and in January, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_63.wav,164204,two thousand ten it becomes ‘ SPSS - An IBM Company.’ 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_64.wav,272684,"Complete transfer of business to IBM was done by October one, two thousand ten. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_65.wav,264684,So SPSS has a long history since nineteen seventy five when it was established under 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_66.wav,222764,"under a company, till today’s its journey through IBM , it is a very good software because "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_67.wav,59884,it is the oldest software. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_68.wav,216044,So if you will go through abo… from this through this software you will get a better result.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_69.wav,254444,"Now we will discuss some other feature of SPSS . Basically, there is an option of split  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_70.wav,281356,file in SPSS . If you want to make for example a histogram separately for a number of samples 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_71.wav,127372,then it is useful to split the file. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_72.wav,202924,"If you have two samples, children and juvenile for example and if you want to have a histogram "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_74.wav,245804,"And choose the variable ‘children’ with respect to group based on, if later on you "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_75.wav,281324,"make a histogram of some variable X, you get a histogram for each variable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_76.wav,271436,"Another option is sort data in SPSS . For facilitating, counting, it is sometimes useful "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_77.wav,69132,to sort data first. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_78.wav,215404,"If you want to count changes from year to year within variable ‘district’, this "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_79.wav,188204,is the example and within each district to sort data by year. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_80.wav,250316,"For doing this, first go to da… ‘data’ and ‘sort cases’ for filling sort by choose "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_81.wav,175372,the variable ‘district’ and ‘year’. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_82.wav,187884,Selecting data is another useful functions in SPSS . If you want to analyse only part 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_83.wav,181196,"of the data, then you can go to ‘data’ and choose ‘select cases’. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_84.wav,284844,"One way of selecting data, you can implement by choosing it, condi…‘condition is satisfied’. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_85.wav,220204,"Observation is satisfying, for example, for some variables X can be selected instead of, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_86.wav,164844,we can take ‘and’ or ‘not’ etcetera. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_87.wav,227244,"For making a histogram in SPSS , go to ‘graph’ and ‘histogram’ and select the variable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_88.wav,47724,It is very easy. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_89.wav,217964,"For making a scatter plot, go to ‘graph’ and ‘scatter’, choose ‘simple’ for "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_90.wav,108524,making a scatter plots.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_92.wav,222444,"So go to, for doing regression, go to ‘analyze’, ‘regression’ and ‘linear’. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_93.wav,147564,Now you can choose your dependant variable and independent variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_94.wav,243564,"If you filled already the data matrix, you can save ‘residuals’ by means of checking "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_31_SPSS_95.wav,153644,‘save’ and choosing for ‘standard’ in the column ‘residual’.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_1.wav,136044,Today we are going to discuss an important module from Research Methodology - Hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_2.wav,149452,While discussing the module we’ll be talking about the meaning and definition of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_3.wav,194636,"hypothesis, the nature of hypothesis, the importance and use of hypothesis in research methodology.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_4.wav,175052,"We’ll also look into the sources of hypothesis, the relationship between variables and hypothesis, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_5.wav,185964,"the types of hypothesis and ending the presentation with characteristics of a good hypothesis, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_6.wav,97004,hypothesis testing and errors in hypothesis testing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_7.wav,197196,"So, while we discuss what is hypothesis, we should start with the meaning of it. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_8.wav,147884,Hypothesis is usually considered as an important mechanism in research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_9.wav,230444,Hypothesis is a tentative assumption made in order to test its logic or empirical consequences. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_10.wav,153004,"If we go by the origin of the word, it is derived from the Greek word Hypotithenai, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_11.wav,145324,"meaning to ‘put under’, or ‘to suppose’. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_12.wav,154252,Etymologically hypothesis is made up two words ‘Hypo’ and ‘Thesis’ which means less 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_13.wav,106284,than or less certain than a thesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_14.wav,230764,It is presumptive statement of a proposition or reasonable guess based upon the available 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_15.wav,98284,evidence which the researcher seeks to prove through his study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_16.wav,167436,A hypothesis will give a plausible explanation that will be tested. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_17.wav,187212,"A hypothesis may seem contrary to the real situation, it may prove to be correct or incorrect. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_18.wav,168716,Hypothesis is needed to be clear and precise and capable of being tested. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_19.wav,189484,It is to be limited in scope and consistent with known or established fact and should 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_20.wav,106924,be ameable to testing within the stipulated time. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_21.wav,193004,It needs to explain what it claims to explain and should have empirical reference. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_22.wav,197164,Goode and Hatt have defined it as ‘a proposition which can be put to test to determine its 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_23.wav,178604,"validity’ and Lundberg says ‘A hypothesis is a tentative generalization, the validity "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_24.wav,68844,of which remains to be tested’. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_25.wav,192364,"In most elementary stage, the hypothesis may be any hunch, guess, imaginative idea "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_26.wav,117804,which becomes the basis for action or investigation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_27.wav,246444,"Hence, a hypothesis is a hunch, assumption, suspicion, assertion or an idea about a phenomenon, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_28.wav,147884,"relationship or situation, the reality of or truth of which you do not know. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_29.wav,161324,"So, a researcher calls these assumptions or hunches hypotheses and they become the basis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_30.wav,56044,of an enquiry. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_31.wav,212844,"In most studies, the hypothesis will be based upon your own or someone else observation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_32.wav,140492,Hypothesis brings clarity and specificity to a research problem. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_33.wav,107596,But it is not essential for all kinds of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_34.wav,152364,"So, the formul… the formulation of the hypothesis provide a study with the focus. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_35.wav,159724,It also tells you what specific aspect of a research problem to investigate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_36.wav,157452,A hypothesis tells you what data to collect and what not to collect thereby providing 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_37.wav,60236,"focus to the study.  41 00:03:38,180 -->  00:03:44,890 As it provides a focus, the construction of a hypothesis enhances objectivity in a study. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_38.wav,113644,A hypothesis may enable you to add to the formulation of a theory. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_39.wav,143404,It enables you to specifically conclude what is true or what is false. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_40.wav,203884,"Lundberg observes, quite often a researcher hypothesis is a predictive statement, capable "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_41.wav,225004,"of being tested by scientific methods, that relates an independent variable to some dependent variable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_42.wav,211884,"So, once we know what actually hypothesis mean, we should also understand the nature of hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_43.wav,163884,The hypothesis is a clear statement of what is intended to be investigated. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_44.wav,211884,It should be specified before research is conducted and openly stated in reporting the results. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_45.wav,140204,"This allows to, One, identify the research objectives. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_46.wav,128364,"Second, to identify the key abstract concepts involved in the research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_47.wav,197804,"Three, to identify its relationship to both the problem statement and the literature review, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_48.wav,178284,and a problem cannot be scientifically solved unless it is reduced to hypothesis form. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_49.wav,193644,It is powerful tool to of advancement of knowledge consistent with existing knowledge and conducive 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_50.wav,55084,to further enquiry. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_51.wav,50924,"It can be tested, verifiable or falsifiable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_52.wav,154284,Hypothesis are not moral or ethical questions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_53.wav,92492,It is neither too specific nor too general. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_54.wav,60876,It is a prediction of consequences. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_55.wav,118124,It is considered valuable even it proven false. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_56.wav,110444,"Once we have understood the hypothesis, the nature of hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_57.wav,116524,Why is it so important in a research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_58.wav,137004,"So, toda… now we are going to discuss the importance of hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_59.wav,145004,"So, hypothesis though an important part of research may not be required in all "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_60.wav,49964,types of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_61.wav,212204,The research which are based on fact finding like historical or descriptive do not need hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_62.wav,187564,"Hillway says that, “When fact finding alone is the aim of the study, a hypothesis is not required.” "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_63.wav,173484,"Whenever possible, a hypothesis is recommended for all major studies to explain observed "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_64.wav,225292,"facts, conditions or behavior and to serve as a guide in the research process. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_65.wav,99596,Hypothesis facilitates the extension of knowledge in an area. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_66.wav,190444,They provide tentative explanations of facts and phenomena and can be tested and validated.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_69.wav,147884,Hypothesis provide the researcher with rational statement consisting of elements expressed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_70.wav,237164,in a logical order or relationship which seeks to describe or to explain conditions or events 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_71.wav,110412,that have not yet been confirmed by the facts. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_72.wav,221196,The hypothesis enable the researcher to relate logically known facts to inlletual… intelligible 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_73.wav,273324,"guess about unknown conditions, it is a guide to the thinking process and the process of discovery. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_74.wav,167724,"Hypothesis provide direction to the research, it defines what is relevant and what is irrelevant, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_75.wav,156844,the hypothesis tells the researcher what he needs to do and find out in his studies. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_76.wav,143084,"Thus, it prevents the review of irrelevant literature and provides a basis for selecting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_77.wav,148204,the sample and the research procedures to be studied in the study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_78.wav,161324,Hypothesis implies the statistical techniques needed in the analysis of data and the relationship 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_79.wav,79404,between the variables to be tested. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_80.wav,206124,It also helps to delimit researchers study in scope so that it does not become broad or unwieldy. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_81.wav,148204,"Hypothesis provides the basis for reporting the conclusion of the study, it serves as "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_82.wav,82284,a framework for drawing conclusions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_83.wav,194284,"In other words, we can say that it provides the outline for setting conclusion in a meaningful way. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_84.wav,181804,"So, hypothesis has very important place in research although it occupies a very small "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_85.wav,79084,place in the body of a thesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_86.wav,223084,"So, once we are done the importance of hypothesis, we should also be seeing that how we can actually derived hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_87.wav,130924,A good hypothesis can only be derived from experience and research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_88.wav,140844,"Though hypothesis should precede the co… collection of data, but some degree of data "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_89.wav,200364,"collection, literature review or a pilot study will help in the development and gradual refinement of the hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_90.wav,199404,A researcher should have quality of an alert mind to derive a hypothesis and quality of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_91.wav,118124,critical mind of rejecting faulty hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_92.wav,137324,The following sources can help the researcher in coming up with a good hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_93.wav,46444,"One, review of literature. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_94.wav,176044,Review of literature is very important in forming a hypothesis because you get an idea 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_95.wav,225324,of what type of hypothesis you need to achieve your objectives and discussion with the experts 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_96.wav,147884,"in the given field to understand the problem, its origin and objective in seeking a solution "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_97.wav,137644,will also help you in forming a very good hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_98.wav,140524,Intuitions of the researcher also sometimes help in forming a good hypothesis because 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_99.wav,162604,you always have an idea what you are looking for in your research and that actually helps 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_100.wav,57324,in forming a good hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_101.wav,184044,Previous empirical studies done on the given area also gi… become a very good source 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_102.wav,172204,for hypothesis when you go through the previous researchers that actually gives an idea what 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_103.wav,182412,you have to look into when you are conducting your own research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_104.wav,139884,Once we know the sources of hypothesis and we have formulated the hypothesis we should 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_105.wav,135116,also understand what all types of hypothesis are there in research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_106.wav,202284,"So research problems are too general by themselves to enable us to carry out meaningful analysis, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_107.wav,109804,they need to be specified in a more focused way. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_108.wav,143724,"Hypothesis are specific statement that relate to the problem, the answer to which are likely "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_109.wav,233612,"to be yes or no depending upon what is uncovered from the research, like suicide is related "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_110.wav,160364,to general level of religiosity or secularization of society. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_111.wav,157484,Another example could be alienation and political participation are negatively related. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_112.wav,172876,"Such statements specify links between different phenomena, in order to explain different pattern "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_113.wav,213772,"of behavior that appear to occur, such statement specify links between different phenomena "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_114.wav,132556,in order to explain different pattern or behavior that appear to occur. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_115.wav,214444,"However, such pattern or association do not necessarily demonstrate that a causal relationship exist. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_116.wav,158732,We cannot for an instance say ‘socio economic deprivation causes suicide.’ 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_117.wav,144716,If that was the case then all those who defined by various yardstick as living in a state 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_118.wav,123212,of relative poverty would inevitably commit suicide. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_119.wav,63756,This is very unlikely to happen. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_120.wav,192652,"So, we if we have to understand types of hypothesis, we do need to understand what are the variables "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_121.wav,94476,that actually affect these types of hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_122.wav,200364,"So, to understand the type of hypothesis, we need to understand the concept of variable first. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_123.wav,151724,The variables are empirical properties that take two or more values or in other words 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_124.wav,128684,a variable is any entity that can take on different values. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_125.wav,252812,"Its, in simple terms, anything that can vary or that is not constant can be considered a variable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_126.wav,162284,For instance age can be considered a variable because age can take different values for 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_127.wav,121964,different people or for the same person at different times. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_128.wav,194956,"Similarly, country can be considered a variable because person’s country can be assigned a value. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_129.wav,176652,A variable is a concept or abstract idea that can be described in measurable term. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_130.wav,198444,"In research this term refers to the measurable characteristics, qualities, traits or attributes "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_131.wav,141484,of a particular individual object or situation being studied. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_132.wav,202604,"Variables differ in many respects, most notably in the role that they are given in our research "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_133.wav,123276,and in the type of measure that can be applied to them. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_134.wav,170252,The restatement of problem usually provides only general direction for the research study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_135.wav,119116,It does not include all the specific information. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_136.wav,175372,There is some basic terminology that is extremely important in how we communicate specific information 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_137.wav,121036,about research problem and research in general. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_138.wav,137644,"So, weight, height, income all are examples of variables. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_139.wav,163212,In research there is a need to make distinction between various kinds of variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_140.wav,101836,There are many classifications given for variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_141.wav,181164,We’ll try to understand only the dependent variables and independent variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_142.wav,151372,"Independent variables - The variables which are manipulated or controlled or changed, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_143.wav,76876,these are also known as manipulated variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_144.wav,201292,Researchers often mistake independent variable and assume that it is independent of any manipulation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_145.wav,186636,It is called independent because variable is isolated from any other factor. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_146.wav,144364,In research we try to determine whether there is a cause and effect relationship. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_147.wav,133132,"In fact, when you are looking for some kind of relationship between variables you are "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_148.wav,158124,trying to say if the independent variable causes some kind of change in the other variable 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_149.wav,83244,or dependent variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_150.wav,102444,And now we are going to discuss what is dependent variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_151.wav,181516,Dependent variables are the outcome variables and are the variables for which we calculate statistics. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_152.wav,151724,The variables which change on account of independent variable is known as dependent variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_153.wav,77804,It is something that depends on the other factors. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_154.wav,170892,"For example, a test score could be dependent variable because it could change depending "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_155.wav,146604,"on the several factor such as how much you studied, how much sleep you got the night "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_156.wav,144364,before you took the test or even how hungry your were when you took it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_157.wav,121964,Usually when you are looking for relationship between the two things you are trying to find 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_158.wav,136716,out what makes the dependent variable change the way it does. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_159.wav,169644,"As we have discussed that a variable is an image, perception or concept that can be measured, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_160.wav,97292,"hence, capable of taking on different values. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_161.wav,209676,The variables that you wish to explain are regarded as dependent variable or criterion variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_162.wav,138892,The other variables expected to explain the change in the dependent variable is referred 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_163.wav,114636,to as an independent variable or predictor variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_164.wav,167052,The dependent variable is the expected outcome of the independent variable and independent 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_165.wav,90956,variable produces dependent variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_166.wav,123212,So variables can have three types of relationships among themselves. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_167.wav,175404,A positive relationship is one where an increase in one would lead to increase in the other. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_168.wav,109516,"For example, more you study higher your score would be. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_169.wav,199372,A negative relationship is one where an increase in one variable leads to decrease in the other. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_170.wav,120716,"More you watch TV, less marks you are going to get. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_171.wav,174732,A zero relationship is one which shows no significant relationship between the two variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_172.wav,147916,"For example, having any kind of food will not fetch you marks. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_173.wav,122892,These are the type of relationship which variables have. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_174.wav,139244,"So, once we have understood variables we can discuss the various type of hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_175.wav,103084,"One, first one is the research hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_176.wav,152044,The research hypothesis could be understood in terms of simple research hypothesis and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_177.wav,60556,complex research hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_178.wav,137292,A simple research hypothesis predicts the relationship between a single independent 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_179.wav,167436,variable and a single dependent variable where as a complex hypothesis predicts the relationship 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_180.wav,148492,between two or more independent variable and two or more dependent variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_181.wav,171884,A research hypothesis must be stated in a testable form for its proper evaluation and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_182.wav,235244,"it should indicate a relationship between variables in clear, concise and understandable language. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_183.wav,136044,Research hypothesis are classified as being directional or non-directional. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_184.wav,151756,A directional hypothesis are usually derived from theory. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_185.wav,168972,They may imply that the researcher is intellectually committed to a particularly outcome. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_186.wav,165196,They specify the expected direction of the relationship between variables that is the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_187.wav,160972,researcher predicts not only the existence of a relation but also its nature. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_188.wav,180204,Non-directional hypothesis on the other hand are used when there is little or no theory 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_189.wav,117804,or when findings of previous studies are contradictory. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_190.wav,71404,They may imply impartiality. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_191.wav,122604,Do not stipulate the direction of the relationship. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_192.wav,201964,another types of association are associative hypothesis and causal hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_193.wav,147564,"Associative hypothesis propose relationship between variables, when one variable changes "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_194.wav,182444,"the other changes, they do not indicate cause and effect, whereas the causal hypothesis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_195.wav,136364,proposes a cause and effect interaction between two or more variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_196.wav,177644,The independent variable is manipulated to cause effect on the dependent variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_197.wav,204524,Then there is a statistical hypothesis to test whether the data support or refute the research hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_198.wav,105036,It needs to be translated into a statistical hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_199.wav,94124,It is given in statistical terms. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_200.wav,140812,"In the context of inferential statistics, it is statement about one or more parameters "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_201.wav,112684,that are measures of the population understudy. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_202.wav,82316,"Now, we need to understand what is this inferential statistics? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_203.wav,185964,Inferential statistics is used for drawing conclusions about population values. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_204.wav,184044,"To use inferential statistics we need to translate the research hypothesis into a testable form, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_205.wav,73292,which is called the null hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_206.wav,209964,A testable hypothesis contains variables that are measurable or able to be manipulated. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_207.wav,183116,They need to predict a relationship that can be supported or not supported based on the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_208.wav,62444,data collection and analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_209.wav,178892,"So, now we come to a very important types of hypothesis which is called as null hypothesis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_210.wav,64364,and alternative hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_211.wav,180876,Null hypothesis are used when the researcher believes that there is no relationship between 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_212.wav,190092,two variables or when there is inadequate theoretical or empirical information to state 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_213.wav,57356,a research hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_214.wav,155884,The null hypothesis represents a theory that has been put forward either because it is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_215.wav,242572,believed to be true or because it is to be used as a basis for argument but has not been proved. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_216.wav,191756,This has serious outcome if incorrect decision is made and null hypothesis are designed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_217.wav,68492,by either HO or HN. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_218.wav,274956,"A null hypothesis can be simple or complex or associative or causal, which we have already seen. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_219.wav,172524,The alternative hypothesis is a statement of what a hypothesis test is setup to establish. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_220.wav,123244,It is designated by H one or HA. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_221.wav,196812,"It is opposite of null hypothesis, it is only reached if HO is rejected. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_222.wav,200364,"Frequently alternative is actual desired conclusion of the researcher, they give special consideration "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_223.wav,72716,to the null hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_224.wav,152364,"This is due to the fact that a null hypothesis relates to the statement being tested, whereas "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_225.wav,180204,the alternative hypothesis relates to the statement to be accepted if when the null 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_226.wav,82892,is hypothesis is rejected. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_227.wav,135116,The final conclusion – Once the test has been carried out is always given in terms 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_228.wav,36492,of the null hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_229.wav,224364,We either reject null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis or do not reject null hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_230.wav,176044,We never conclude reject alternative hypothesis or even accept alternative hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_231.wav,176684,"If we conclude do not reject null hypothesis, this does not necessarily mean that the null "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_232.wav,172204,"hypothesis is true, it is only suggest, it only suggest that there is not sufficient "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_233.wav,165196,evidence against null hypothesis in favour of alternative hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_234.wav,234572,Rejecting the null hypothesis then suggest that alternative hypothesis maybe true. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_235.wav,130636,"For example, alternative hypothesis – the males visited cinema more than females and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_236.wav,152364,the null hypothesis – the males and females do not differ in respect of the frequency 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_237.wav,39404,of seeing the cinema. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_238.wav,148812,"So, alternative hypothesis is usually the one which one wishes to prove and the null "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_239.wav,134796,hypothesis is the one with one wishes to disapprove. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_240.wav,95084,And now once we are done with the types of hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_241.wav,208364,Let's understand how hypothesis is formulated because that is the most important concept in research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_242.wav,194572,There are no precise rules for formulating hypothesis and deducing consequences but there 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_243.wav,114636,are some difficulties that arise in formulating the hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_244.wav,144972,"However, there are certain necessary conditions that are conducive to the formation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_245.wav,199724,"They are for example, richness of background knowledge, in the absence of knowledge concerning "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_246.wav,179596,"a subject matter, one can make know well founded judgment of relevant hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_247.wav,164492,Background knowledge is essential for perceiving relationship among the variables and to determine 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_248.wav,146316,what finding other researcher have reported on the problem under study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_249.wav,173772,"New knowledge, new discoveries and new inventions should always form continuity with the already "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_250.wav,174796,existing corpus of knowledge and therefore it becomes all the more essential to be well 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_251.wav,115884,versed with the already existing knowledge. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_252.wav,188844,Hypothesis can be formulated correctly by person who have rich experience and academic 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_253.wav,132524,background but they can never be formulated by those who have poor background knowledge. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_254.wav,224012,"There is another point which is very important in formulating hypothesis, logical and scientific approach.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_255.wav,164844,Formulation of proper hypothesis depends on one's experience and logical insights. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_256.wav,117196,Hypothesis does not have a clear cut and definite theoretical background. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_257.wav,187884,Partly it is a matter of lifting upon an idea on some problem and it is not always possible 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_258.wav,231052,to have complete information of an acquaintance with the scientific method for formulating hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_259.wav,142476,This lack of scientific knowledge presents difficulty in formulation of hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_260.wav,208684,A researcher may begin a study by selecting one of the theories in his own areas of interest 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_261.wav,170604,and deduce a hypothesis from this theory through logic which is possible only when the researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_262.wav,177324,has a proper understanding of the scientific method and has a versatile intellect. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_263.wav,144364,"At times, conversations and consultations with colleagues and experts from different "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_264.wav,151404,fields are also helpful in formulating important and useful hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_265.wav,160972,And now once we know how to formulate a hypothesis there are few things that need to be kept 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_266.wav,208684,"in mind in forming a hypothesis, and tha… they are called as the characteristics of good hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_267.wav,163916,Hulley says a good hypothesis must be based on a good research question. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_268.wav,113644,"It should be simple, specific and stated in advance. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_269.wav,197804,"So, a hypothesis could be called as a good hypothesis if it possesses the following characteristics. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_270.wav,160332,"One, hypothesis should be simple so that it is easily understood by everyone. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_271.wav,141164,"Two, hypothesis should be clear, specific and precise. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_272.wav,164876,"If the hypothesis is not clear and precise, the inference drawn on its basis cannot be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_273.wav,78092,taken as reliable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_274.wav,101164,Hypothesis should be capable of being tested. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_275.wav,126764,Hypothesis should state relationship between variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_276.wav,138636,Hypothesis should be consistent with most known facts that is it must be consistent 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_277.wav,97292,with substantial body of essential facts. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_278.wav,176044,The hypothesis must explain the facts that gave rise to the need of explanation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_279.wav,196204,It must actually explain what it claims to explain and once if we keep these points in 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_280.wav,112684,mind we are going to formulate a very good hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_281.wav,215084,"So, a very important thing, when we are forming a hypothesis we should also know how to test a hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_282.wav,170636,"When the purpose of the research is to test a research hypothesis, it is termed as hypothesis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_283.wav,39404,testing research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_284.wav,127052,It can be of experimental design or non-experimental design. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_285.wav,186316,Research in which the independent variable is manipulated is termed as experimental hypothesis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_286.wav,165132,testing research and a research in which an independent variable is not manipulated is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_287.wav,143724,called as non-experimental hypothesis testing research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_288.wav,134156,"As we have discussed then null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis earlier, so while "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_289.wav,155212,"testing the hypothesis we generally proceed on the basis of null hypothesis, keeping the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_290.wav,57676,alternative hypothesis in view. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_291.wav,201292,We do so because on the assumption that null hypothesis is true one can assign the probabilities 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_292.wav,184364,to different possible sample results but this cannot be done if we proceed with the alternative 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_293.wav,32044,hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_294.wav,121676,"Hence, the use of null hypothesis is quite frequent. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_295.wav,116844,While testing the hypothesis the following things have to be kept in mind. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_296.wav,77772,"First, the level of significance. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_297.wav,123276,This is a very important concept in the context of hypothesis testing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_298.wav,168972,It is always some percentage usually five percent which should be chosen with great 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_299.wav,64684,care and thought and reason. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_300.wav,180556,In case we take the significance level at five percent then this implies that null hypothesis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_301.wav,201644,will be rejected when the sampling result has a less than zero point zero five probability of occurring. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_302.wav,170284,In other words these five percent level of significance means that researcher is willing 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_303.wav,198412,to take as much as of five percent risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it happens 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_304.wav,42636,to be true. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_305.wav,188524,"Thus, the significance level is the maximum value of the probability of rejecting null "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_306.wav,232652,hypothesis when it is true and is usually determine in advance before testing the hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_307.wav,98956,The criteria for rejecting the null hypothesis may differ. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_308.wav,160044,Sometimes the null hypothesis is rejected only when the quantity of the outcome is so 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_309.wav,177004,large that the probability of its having occurred by mere chance is one times out of hundred. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_310.wav,179244,We consider the probability of its having occurred by a chance to be too little and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_311.wav,208684,we reject the chance theory of the null hypothesis and take the occurrence to be due to genuine tendency. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_312.wav,191404,On the other occasions we may reject the null hypothesis even when the quantity of the reported 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_313.wav,137932,outcome is likely to occur by chance five times out of hundred. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_314.wav,181836,Statistically the former is known as the rejection of null hypothesis at zero point one level 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_315.wav,123884,and the latter is known as the rejection and zero point five level. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_316.wav,180844,It may be pointed out that if the researcher is able to reject the null hypothesis he cannot 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_317.wav,92524,directly uphold the declarative hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_318.wav,171564,"If an outcome is not held to be due to chance, it does not mean that it is due to the very "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_319.wav,88652,cause-and-effect relationship asserted in the particular declarative statement. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_320.wav,244204,It may be due to something else which the researcher may have failed to control. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_321.wav,176396,Declaration of a rule or test of hypothesis in other point we need to keep in mind. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_322.wav,173804,Given a null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis we make a rule which is known as decisive 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_323.wav,174732,rule according to which we accept null hypothesis or reject null hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_324.wav,236844,"For instance, if we, if null hypothesis that a certain lot is good, then there are very "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_325.wav,194316,"few defective items in it against alternative hypothesis that the lot is not good, where "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_326.wav,169292,"there are many, there are too many defective items in it, then we must decide the number "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_327.wav,164876,of items to be tested and the criteria for accepting or rejecting the hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_328.wav,195884,We might test ten times in the lot and plan our decision saying that if there are none 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_329.wav,177964,"or only one defective items among the ten, we will accept null hypothesis otherwise we "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_330.wav,156524,will reject null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_331.wav,91564,This sort of basis is known as decision rule. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_332.wav,172812,"When we are discussing the testing of hypothesis, the important thing that need to be discussed "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_333.wav,172204,"is the two-tailed and one-tailed test, in the context of hypothesis testing these two "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_334.wav,150156,terms are quite important and must be clearly understood. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_335.wav,179884,A two-tailed test rejects the null hypothesis if say the sample mean is significantly higher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_336.wav,109452,or lower than the hypothesized value of the mean of the population. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_337.wav,247436,Such a test is appropriate when the null hypothesis is some specific specified value and the alternative 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_338.wav,146252,hypothesis is a value not equal to the specified value of null hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_339.wav,184716,"In a two-tailed test there are two rejection reasons, one on each tail of the curve which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_340.wav,206412,can be illustrated as if the significance level is five percent and the two-tailed test 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_341.wav,213836,"is to be applied, the probability of the rejection area will be zero point zero zero five equally "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_342.wav,218892,divided on both tails of the curve is zero point zero zero two five and that of the acceptance 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_343.wav,73996,reason will be zero point nine five. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_344.wav,160972,But there are situations when only one-tailed test is considered appropriate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_345.wav,196524,A one-tailed test would be used when we are to test say whether the population mean is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_346.wav,148844,either lower than or higher than some hypothesized value. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_347.wav,203564,We should always remember that accepting null hypothesis on the basis of sample information 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_348.wav,169996,"does not constitute the proof that null hypothesis, is true. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_349.wav,189452,The only mean that there is no statistical ev… evidence to rejected. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_350.wav,213836,And finally we come to the last part of it which is the errors in testing the hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_351.wav,152044,There are basically two types of errors we make in the context of testing of hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_352.wav,119052,These are called as Type one and Type two error. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_353.wav,162316,In Type one error we may reject null hypothesis when null hypothesis is true. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_354.wav,184044,"In Type two error when we accept null hypothesis, when the null hypothesis is not true. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_355.wav,184652,In other word Type one error means rejection of hypothesis which should have been accepted 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_356.wav,183436,and Type two error means accepting the hypothesis which should have been rejected. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_357.wav,206764,Type one error is denoted by alpha known as alpha error also called the level of significance 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_358.wav,162252,of test and Type two error is denoted by Beta known as beta error. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_359.wav,180844,The probability of Type one error is usually determined in advance and is understood as 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_360.wav,110156,the level of significance of testing the hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_361.wav,155884,If Type one error is fixed at five percent it means that means that there are about five 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_362.wav,155884,chances in hundred that we will reject null hypothesis when null hypothesis is true. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_363.wav,167724,We cannot control Type one error just by fixing at a lower level. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_364.wav,165772,For instance if we fix it at one percent we will say that the maximum probability of committing 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_365.wav,208076,Type one error would be zero point zero one but with the fixed sample size when we try 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_366.wav,187244,"to reduce Type one error, the probability of committing Type two error increases. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_367.wav,125772,Both types of error cannot be reduced simultaneously. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_368.wav,166156,There is a tradeoff between two types of error which means that the probability of making 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_369.wav,192332,one type of error can only be reduced if we are willing to increase the probability of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_370.wav,76556,making the other type of error. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_371.wav,240684,One must set a very high level of Type one error in one’s testing technique of a given hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_372.wav,184332,"Hence, in the testing of hypothesis one must make all possible effort to strike an adequate "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_373.wav,105676,balance between Type one and Type two errors. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_374.wav,191084,And this brings to a conclusion of the module and in this module what we have done is we 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_375.wav,135404,have discussed the definition and types of hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_376.wav,140492,"We have also seen the testing of hypothesis, the errors that are there in hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_377.wav,134764,How do we formulate a good hypothesis and what are the characteristics of good hypothesis? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_7_Hypothesis_378.wav,97676,"I hope this module will be of a great help to you, thank you.  "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_10.wav,183084,"In ordinary term if we try to understand this concept, research design is a planning of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_11.wav,150412,detailed outline of any research work.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_15.wav,198124,By this term design we can easily understand this is the shape of research and this shape 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_16.wav,249644,"of research can be designed in any way, this is the free wish of the researcher. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_17.wav,159724,But it should be objectively satisfied.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_26.wav,264684,The research design should be the proper in the light of the objectives of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_27.wav,296716,"Basically, designing, research designing is an independent choice of researcher. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_32.wav,93164,This is the pattern of work in research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_33.wav,201004,"If the person is already familiar, experienced in doing research in any particular area of "

"
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_36.wav,216396,This research design contain the procedure and method or in easy word we can say this 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_37.wav,169964,is the blueprint of whole research work before going to start any task.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_52.wav,166796,This is a blueprint which is usually required for starting any work. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_53.wav,310412,This blueprint containing both the substantive steps and procedural aspect involved therewith.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_58.wav,295052,and it works as a guide to researcher in the field that what shall be his further step 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_59.wav,227916,"and what step is required to be taken by him in any particular, appropriate manner. "

"
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_61.wav,167436,There is a question dispute regarding this particular aspect whether the research design 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_62.wav,168652,comes into action after formulation of research problem or before.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_64.wav,301484,view of the scientists this is the design means where the person apply his mind with the subject. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_65.wav,215084,"And formulation of research problem, we find there is the involvement of the researcher "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_88.wav,295084,That means substantially the researcher has to design the his research process with these

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_110.wav,278764,By looking into the research design one can easily understand that what research problem

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_0.wav,32044,Hello everyone. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_1.wav,174444,"Today, we are going to discuss a new chapter of Research Methodology – that is Qualitative Research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_2.wav,158156,"As you must have heard about the term ‘research’, it is divided into two parts - One is quantitative "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_3.wav,49644,and the other is qualitative research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_4.wav,163564,Hope you are having a better understanding by learning all other modules of what is quantitative

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_6.wav,218284,"So, to make your concepts more clear, today, I’ll focus only on qualitative research in this module. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_7.wav,121964,"So, I am back again with a new module and I am Ritu Sharma. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_8.wav,222764,I will be discussing here about the qualitative research and in this we will try to see the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_9.wav,138284,"possibilities for using qualitative approaches and methods in research product, projects. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_10.wav,168364,We’ll also try to provide an overview of the logic of qualitative research and its

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_12.wav,148524,And then we will try to define the qualitative research approach and cro… contrast this 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_13.wav,74284,with the quantitative research approach. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_14.wav,169932,"To review the main methods for conducting qualitative research project in depth, one "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_16.wav,180524,"Then finally, we’ll highlight the main issues confronting social researchers when using "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_17.wav,91884,qualitative approach and method in research projects. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_18.wav,199052,"Now, the qualitative research style is more often than not associated with an interpretative "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_19.wav,187916,"perspective in social research, in which the logic of research is not so much to test out "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_20.wav,178636,"given theories about what guides human behaviour, but instead to develop an appreciation of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_21.wav,146892,the underlying motivation that people have for doing what they do. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_22.wav,161004,"Now, to underly… the underlying the quantitative research style, then is the assumption that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_23.wav,200364,"in order to understand human behaviour, a researcher must first understand the meaning "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_24.wav,195884,"that people have of the world around them, because these meanings tend to govern their actions.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_25.wav,190092,The emphasis given by qualitative researcher to their studies is therefore involves an 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_26.wav,198476,"examination of the perspectives of the people or groups that are of interest to them, their "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_27.wav,70092,"ideas, attitude, motives and intentions. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_28.wav,165836,Qualitative research methods such as in depth interviews and participant observation shares 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_29.wav,57292,some of the following characteristics. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_30.wav,136396,"First, research is carried out in real life settings. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_31.wav,170252,"In order to build up the understanding of how people experience the world around them, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_32.wav,188236,"and to identify what informs their behaviour, the researcher attempts to study actions and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_33.wav,172172,"talk as it naturally occurs, with as little disruption to people’s life as possible. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_34.wav,184044,"The second point is, quantitative methods, such as questionnaires, surveys and experiments "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_35.wav,193644,"are scheduled as leading to creation of relatively artificial research situation, in which it "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_36.wav,123884,is possible to study real views and real behaviour. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_37.wav,172204,The objective is to take detailed description of people’s behaviour and thoughts to illuminate 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_38.wav,48044,their social meanings. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_39.wav,174124,"This implies adopting an insider’s perspective in research, in which there is likely to be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_40.wav,181484,"a closeness between the researcher and the people to be studied, rather than an impersonal "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_41.wav,39756,and distanced relationship. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_42.wav,208044,"For instance, an organization based study of absenteeism made, entail a researcher spending "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_43.wav,191692,"considerable time at the workplace, observing how work is organized, the relationship between "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_44.wav,108556,actors and developing a non-threating presence. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_45.wav,173132,"From this vantage point, the researcher will aim to develop a rapport with the employee "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_46.wav,159724,"to gain their trust and confidence, in order to encourage them to speak fully and frankly "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_47.wav,108524,about issues that may be associated with the absentees. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_48.wav,233964,The researcher is likely to adopt an approach in which there is no precise initial specification 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_49.wav,61836,of research issue and concepts. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_50.wav,178924,The focus of the research may change during the course of collecting data as ideas develop 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_51.wav,57292,and particular issues become important. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_52.wav,163564,The qualitative approach involves theory construction rather than theory testing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_53.wav,187884,Theoretical ideas developed from initial data collection and then go on to influence further 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_54.wav,210956,"data collection, there is a cumulative spiral theory developed and data collection is there. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_55.wav,73292,"Now, defining the qualitative research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_56.wav,77484,What actually we mean by this qualitative research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_57.wav,163276,There is some disagreement about how to define a qualitative style of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_58.wav,183084,"Perhaps, the easiest way to begin with is what researchers do, and how this distinguishes "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_59.wav,136332,them from researchers using other approaches from this point of view. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_60.wav,89676,Qualitative research has several important features. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_61.wav,205164,"It involves, first, the study of one or small number of cases, often over a lengthy period of time.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_62.wav,185964,"Second, in organizational research, for instance, studies frequently focus on a single agency "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_63.wav,143084,or in small numbers of department or employees within the agency. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_64.wav,155884,"In educational research, the focus may be a single school or perhaps a number of classroom, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_65.wav,147244,teachers and or pupils within or particular sch… school. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_66.wav,152652,"In this context, the data collection process is characterized as being intensive. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_67.wav,205228,Very detailed study involves the collection of large quantities of data from a small number

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_205.wav,247404,"These interviews therefore, allow respondent to lead the researcher into exploring relatively uncharted terrain. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_206.wav,235244,"Using this method, respondents are also encouraged to provide examples in order to ground their narrative. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_207.wav,174444,A related feature of this approach is that interviewer will aim to develop some form 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_208.wav,79084,of social rapport with the respondent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_209.wav,181484,"In any project involving unstructured interviews, the relationship between the researcher and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_210.wav,100524,those who are researched is crucial. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_211.wav,132524,This is considered an essential requirement for this method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_212.wav,182124,"First, without such a rapport, it is difficult to convince respondent to participate in the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_213.wav,122604,"interview, and to talk fully and frankly about the issue addressed. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_214.wav,180524,"Secondly, many researcher and in particular feminist researcher, would argue that developing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_215.wav,209644,"such a relationship as a part of wider humanist interviewing approach, assist in reducing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_216.wav,79084,unequal power relations in the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_217.wav,177964,"Here, interviews are less formal and less structured, and invite the interviewee to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_218.wav,84204,take part in setting the agendas. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_219.wav,189164,"There is also a shared exchange of information, rather than the one-way expression of data "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_223.wav,32044,to record the exchange. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_224.wav,63084,This serves several purpose. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_225.wav,183724,"It enables the researcher to capture a full transcript of the interview, which is considerably "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_226.wav,124524,more difficult when reliant on note-taking. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_227.wav,187244,"This also frees the researcher to reflect more carefully on the course of the interview, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_228.wav,188524,"to think about the responses given, and to plan the next line of questioning, and also "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_229.wav,198124,to take reflective notes and comments about the issues raised in the interview that might

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_231.wav,166444,"Researchers should also take notes on any interesting non-verbal data, such as body "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_232.wav,191404,language and any particular episode or events that occur during the course of the interview 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_233.wav,167404,"that may have a hearing on, how the data should be contextualized and understood. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_234.wav,229484,Data from tape recordings can also be open to public inspection by others providing opportunity 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_235.wav,264364,for interested peers to scrutinize and either validate or challenge reported findings and interpretations. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_236.wav,148844,This will also significantly increase data reliability. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_237.wav,174444,Making recordings and full transcripts publicly available also enables others to check that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_238.wav,195564,"interviews have been conducted in a professional manner, with data that faithfully represents "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_239.wav,198764,"the voice of respondents, rather than reflecting the values and bias of a manipulative researcher. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_240.wav,132844,Then other technique of data collection is the focus groups. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_241.wav,149484,"Qualitative interviews that are held with the group of participants, a focus groups "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_242.wav,219884,"are done, so with a different purpose in mind, from those held with just one respondent. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_243.wav,186284,"The central purpose for both is to collect data that accurately reflects the thoughts, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_244.wav,75884,feelings and opinion of the respondents. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_245.wav,178924,"However, in focus group the intention is to stimulate discussion among people and bring "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_246.wav,146924,to the surface responses that otherwise might lay dormant. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_247.wav,178924,Such discussions may enable participants to clarify their views and opinion positions 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_248.wav,236204,"or, on the basis of engagement with others to articulate more clearly than they o… otherwise might. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_249.wav,233324,The interactive dynamic therefore considered to be a crucial element of the focus group approach. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_250.wav,199404,The interviewer or moderator will use a variety of techniques to encourage respondent to debate 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_251.wav,199724,"topics and issues, to challenge opinions expressed by others, to identify the areas of consensus "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_252.wav,180204,"and disagreement, and to collect examples with which to el… illuminate the concept. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_253.wav,260524,The membership of a focus group is usually determined by some shared attributes among participants. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_254.wav,148204,"This might be an experience, a known opinion position, a socio-demographic characteristics, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_255.wav,44844,or some other variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_256.wav,206444,"Thus, sum form of the theoretical sampling method is used in the selection of focus group "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_257.wav,123884,"membership, so that a degree of homogeneity is evident. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_258.wav,43244,This is very important. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_259.wav,228844,Too much difference and heterogeneity and the focus group may become unwielded and unmanageable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_260.wav,214764,"By contrast, where participants in a particular focus group share an important attribute, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_261.wav,239404,it is or for the researcher to identify shared position and areas of disagreement or potential 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_262.wav,214124,discrepancies and contrast broad group opinion with those emerging from other focus group 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_263.wav,152044,whose membership is based upon the alternative attributes. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_264.wav,192044,"Ethnography and observation is another method, which is very important for qualitative research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_265.wav,153324,"Apart from in-depth interviewing and focus group, the other major method that is used "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_266.wav,108204,by qualitative researcher is ethnography study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_267.wav,190764,"Through the observation of institutions, cultures, and customs, the researcher will aim to investigate "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_272.wav,72364,This is an important point to note. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_273.wav,162284,Researcher undertake ethnographic studies to see the world in a new way from the point 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_274.wav,170284,"of view of the people under investigation, not just to confirm their preconception about "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_275.wav,115884,a particular issue or group that they are studying. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_276.wav,188844,"This involves looking hard to all aspects of what is going on, not picking out one or "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_277.wav,219564,two events and using them to confirm taken-for-granted views about the nature of the social world. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_278.wav,194604,"Thus, the ethnographer does not just observe and record the unusual extreme behaviour, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_279.wav,212844,but joins in the everyday activities and life of those who are being studied. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_280.wav,190764,"The researcher observes social interaction and talks informally with group members, aiming "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_281.wav,178284,to acquire cultural knowledge and identify and make sense of patterns of social interaction 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_282.wav,79084,in people's natural environment. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_283.wav,165484,"This style of research is often referred as naturalistic, and assumed that the study of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_284.wav,207724,people's behaviour can only be conducted in situation where people do not feel under surveillance. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_285.wav,220524,"The task of the researcher, therefore, is to observe people in a sensitive and unobtrusive fashion. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_286.wav,185964,"Usually, this involves spending time in the field so that the researcher gains acceptance "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_287.wav,115564,among the community that he or she is investigating. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_288.wav,227244,"Ethnography refers to more than just the process of observing, it includes holding interviews, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_292.wav,207724,The Ethnographic approach may also involve the use of quantitative methods such as questionnaire. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_293.wav,178924,"The main research method associated with ethnography, however, is participant observation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_294.wav,184684,Participant observation involves the researcher in becoming part of a group or situation that

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_298.wav,215724,One of the most important decision open to the researcher is selection of a site for a study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_299.wav,179564,"Owing to the time and resources constraint, observations are often limited to only one "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_300.wav,191084,"or small number of research sites, and as such the researcher should consider taking "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_301.wav,239756,steps to ensure that this or these are typical of the many such settings available for the study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_302.wav,236812,The research will often find several possibilities and the decision should be driven largely 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_303.wav,152044,by the anticipated richness of the data that particular sites others. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_304.wav,177004,"Beyond this, as an ethnographer you should choose a setting that is relatively easier "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_305.wav,212524,"than the others to gain access to, although preferably one that is not familiar, where "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_306.wav,251564,you have no particular knowledge or expertise and where you are most open to record the unexpected.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_308.wav,225964,Physical access refers to the process through which the researcher is able actually to enter the site. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_309.wav,207724,This may involve the participant observation seeking permission from a gatekeeper to enter 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_310.wav,142444,"a particular setting, such as a school or a hospital, and may require some negotiation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_311.wav,212844,"Inevitably, there are political consequences in any such negotiation, and the researcher "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_313.wav,171244,to compromise some aspect of the proposed research strategy. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_19_Qualitative_Research_314.wav,190764,Social access requires the researcher to gain a vantage point through which he or she can

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_62.wav,173164,Qualitative non-numerical methods will obviously not provide the researcher with the numerical 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_63.wav,50924,answer we want. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_64.wav,252204,"Secondly, numerical change can likewise accurately be studied only by using quantitative methods. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_65.wav,223372,Are the numbers of students joining the school has improved due to education policy and legal reforms? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_66.wav,154316,The researcher needs to undertake a qualitative study to find out. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_67.wav,233324,"Thirdly, in order to find out about the state of something or other, the researcher often "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_68.wav,94732,wants to explain phenomena. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_69.wav,124556,What factors predict the judicial outcomes?

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_71.wav,225324,These kinds of question can only be studied successfully by quantitative methods. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_72.wav,236172,"Fourthly, quantitative research is specially suited in the testing of hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_73.wav,271724,"We might want to explain something, for example, whether there is a relationship between convicts "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_74.wav,121996,and their self-esteem and social background? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_75.wav,242924,"We could look at the theory and come up with the hypothesis that weaker, social, economic "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_76.wav,210284,background leads to low self-esteem which would in turn be related to the tendency to

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_78.wav,189196,What is the relationship between quantitative and qualitative research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_79.wav,245804,"Conversely, qualitative research provides detailed description and analysis of the quality "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_80.wav,80044,or the substance of the human experience. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_81.wav,139244,They share some commonalities both in theory and practice. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_82.wav,221132,"They cannot be called exactly diametrically opposite, both quantitative and qualitative "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_83.wav,247116,"research is both built on the empirical methods to decipher the workings of social, cultural "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_84.wav,104364,and legal processes. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_85.wav,179564,They differ however in how they go about this deciphering. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_86.wav,234924,Regardless of methodological experiences and theoretical differences both agree that social 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_87.wav,144332,research would be based on the real world. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_88.wav,254764,"Interviews, interactions, documents, observations etcetera, in the social world. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_89.wav,240396,"Where philosophy givers may contemplate the very existence of world, researchers would "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_90.wav,184044,accept that there is a social reality worthy of investigation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_91.wav,215372,They also share the belief that the scientific enquiry shall be logical and consistent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_93.wav,180204,Then what are the differences in qualitative and quantitative methods? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_94.wav,262764,"There are differences in sampling, differences in manner how the data is recorded, differences "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_95.wav,187852,"in data analysis, differences in their views and significance. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_96.wav,227596,"First, we will discuss the difference in sampling. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_97.wav,202252,In quantitative research one of the first steps in conducting a quantitative research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_98.wav,142444,is a selection of respondents or participants. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_99.wav,276236,The precondition of a statistical analysis requires that respondents be selected randomly. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_100.wav,124524,This process is referred to as sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_101.wav,252844,The people and objects selected from a specified population is known as a sample. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_102.wav,216332,"The sample should be large and representative, reason being that small size increases the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_103.wav,148876,probability of biased result or error. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_104.wav,236844,In qualitative research it is less technical and more about theoretical considerations. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_105.wav,195244,"Sampling techniques in qualitative research are purposive, meaning that the theoretical "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_106.wav,250924,purpose of the research mandates the selection process and not the strict methodological mandate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_107.wav,149164,"While studying about drug peddlers, random sampling is impossible. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_108.wav,132204,Purposive approach therefore is the only option. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_109.wav,318444,Now we will discuss the difference in the manner how the data is recorded. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_110.wav,266572,Quantitative researchers quantify their observations using a pre-coded form referred to as a survey. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_111.wav,209996,"However, not every study can be done that way because it can have many complexities. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_112.wav,257324,"Say, for example, if we have to study motor accidents, it might be the case that the cause "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_113.wav,287404,"of an accident might be intoxication, which was pre-coded as one or maybe driver, or maybe "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_114.wav,143084,"driver was minor, which was pre-coded as two. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_115.wav,268812,"Now, what if it is both the causes would be marked as just one or just two or both. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_116.wav,186284,"That is the problem a researcher might face, so it becomes necessary to narrate a brief "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_117.wav,156876,"description of the accident on the basis of the count of the victim, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_118.wav,56652,"onlookers, police reports, and so on. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_119.wav,297356,"So, therein might be a case where it has to be further described using qualitative methods. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_120.wav,217644,The difference in data analysis- The data analysis in quantitative research is based 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_121.wav,143692,on statistics using a formula based approach. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_122.wav,211276,It is an ever expanding and diverse field and can involve analyzing one variable at 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_123.wav,305644,"a time, exploring relationship between two variables or testing relationships among various variables. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_124.wav,250284,"In comparison, qualitative approach is less formula based but rather more emphasis is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_125.wav,176652,"laid on the context, social or cultural. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_126.wav,311436,"Now, the differences in the views and significance of the two methods- The quantitative research "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_127.wav,137324,is by and large detached from methods. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_128.wav,202892,It introduces a theory initially in order to establish the rational of the research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_129.wav,258636,and returns to it at the end of the research in order to advance the policy implication. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_130.wav,167724,The concerns are phrased in statistical or numerical terms. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_131.wav,187564,The qualitative differs in the sense that it tends to focus upon the quid pro quo of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_132.wav,67884,the theory and methods. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_134.wav,164204,Quantitative formulation can be explained by way of an example. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_135.wav,224652,The example is entirely hypothetical and does not intend to reflect the true state of law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_136.wav,205804,There can be factors which the court shall consider in order to decide a case. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_137.wav,241036,"Like, for example, in a dispute concerning copyright infringement the defense of fair "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_138.wav,246764,"use is taken, then the court has to consider the nature and scope of the copyright work, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_148.wav,208364,"What decision can be extended , what decision can be expected on that basis in a case in "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_152.wav,84844,answer to this question. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_153.wav,210892,If it can be assumed however that available decisions as well as future decisions form 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_154.wav,200044,"a consistent pattern of judicial action, a mathematical model can be designed which provides "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_155.wav,129676,an answer to this very question. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_156.wav,214124,"In the proposed model, each case will be treated as an equation in which the decision is a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_157.wav,185644,function of the combination of the controlling circumstances in the case. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_158.wav,204204,"Accordingly, the circumstances of the case are the independent variables in the question "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_159.wav,159404,and the decision is the dependent variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_160.wav,189804,"In this fashion, the cases which already have been decided provide a set of simultaneous "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_161.wav,251884,equations in which the weights of the controlling circumstances are the unknowns. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_162.wav,218284,By solving these equations a weight is found for each of the controlling circumstances 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_163.wav,224684,"and by substituting these weights in the equation, which represent represents a new case, a numerical "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_164.wav,216684,index for the particular combination of circumstances and for the corresponding decision is obtained.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_166.wav,188556,for any combination of circumstances and for its corresponding decision can be determined. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_167.wav,179212,Now we shall discuss something about analyzing the data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_168.wav,127436,The data can assume many shapes and forms. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_169.wav,202284,The role of analysis is to bring data together in a meaningful way and enable the researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_170.wav,105644,and the audience to interpret it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_171.wav,279404,"The steps are as follows- the first step is to classify the data, the second step is to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_173.wav,146284,The fourth is to find the standard deviation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_174.wav,263084,The fifth step is associating the data and sixth step is to draw inferential analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_175.wav,287404,"First, we will discuss the classifying of the data. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_176.wav,226924,"Before analyzing the data, it is essential to classify or codify it. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_178.wav,154284,This is the method of preparing the data for analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_179.wav,116844,It is organizing the data to analyze it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_180.wav,267244,"For example, converting the responses in a questionnaire form and coding them in numeric forms. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_181.wav,89644,The analysis depends on the data type. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_182.wav,245484,"For example, the number of juvenile offenders involved in violent crimes every year in relation "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_183.wav,166764,to a particular offence would be a qualitative data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_184.wav,196172,The coding frame is dependent on the amount of data researcher is having and the requirement 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_185.wav,95756,of the audience. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_186.wav,232972,"If it is concerned with details, more categories are required and if it is a broad overview, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_187.wav,123564,lesser categories would be needed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_188.wav,129356,The second step is about analyzing the data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_189.wav,209644,"The data can be analyzed on a descriptive basis, that is to describe the data. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_190.wav,215724,It may also be an analysis that questions the data or tests hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_191.wav,248684,It is inferential analysis and involves subjecting the data to a statistical analysis.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_195.wav,83244,They might be variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_196.wav,163564,A variable can either be dependent or independent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_197.wav,205132,A dependent variable is one that would change following an increase or decrease in an independent

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_201.wav,266604,The data can be presented in numbers on a graph or in the form of percentages. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_202.wav,223404,This type of analysis provides a description of the data which can be easily read as it 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_203.wav,209324,is reduced from the mass and have been split upon the basis of various factors. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_204.wav,69164,It can be a tally chart. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_205.wav,119404,"However, it can further be conveniently reduced to groups. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_206.wav,145612,"Say, age groups that uses a five-year category. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_207.wav,257036,"For example, figure one presents the age of offenders in auto burglary in the year two "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_208.wav,61164,thousand thirteen. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_209.wav,246412,Figure two is in the form of tally representing the age of the offenders in one row and the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_210.wav,205836,numbers of offenders of that age in another row below the first one whereas figure three 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_211.wav,287084,is on the basis of age groups representing the number of offenders that fall in a particular age group. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_212.wav,254412,"Looking at these figures, one can safely suggest that figure three is more informative in answering "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_213.wav,176044,as to which age group was found to be most involved in auto theft as compared to figure 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_214.wav,149196,one and figure two. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_215.wav,231052,"The third step is finding the mode, median and mean of the quantitative data. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_216.wav,194636,The mode of a group of data is the most frequently occurring value. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_217.wav,223404,The median is the value that separates the upper half of a list of values from the lower half. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_218.wav,265004,The mean is the average that is sum of total values divided by the number of values. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_219.wav,138284,They are all measures of what is known as central tendency. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_220.wav,192044,"One, which best describes the group. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_221.wav,214124,The fourth step is to find the standard deviation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_222.wav,145644,Standard deviation is a tool to measure dispersion. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_223.wav,218924,"It shows the relation, a set of value has to the mean. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_224.wav,136332,Fifth step is of associating data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_225.wav,165516,Some of the researchers’ data would require him to explore relationship between two different 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_226.wav,89324,sets of variables. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_227.wav,109484,This is also known as correlation research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_228.wav,225644,"There are numerous methods for doing that, but the two most popular methods are Spearman’s "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_229.wav,283884,rank order correlation coefficient and Pearson’s product movement correlation coefficient. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_230.wav,170892,And the last step is to draw inferential analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_231.wav,240076,It assists the researcher in making conclusions about the data by performing certain operations on it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_232.wav,214124,"With inferential analysis, the researcher is inferring from his sample data what the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_233.wav,272364,"population’s scores are, sample is a selection taken from a group, it can be called to be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_234.wav,104972,the representation of that group. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_235.wav,214476,"As a result, the findings of the sample can be generalized back to the group. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_236.wav,158412,The population is a group who share the same characteristics. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_237.wav,181196,The major difference between differential analysis and inferential analysis is that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_238.wav,206732,the researcher in the former aims to describe the data while in the later he aims at making 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_239.wav,180204,conclusions about it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_240.wav,163244,Let us now summarize what we have learned in the present module. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_241.wav,247724,"In this module, we discussed the meaning and nature of quantitative research and its relationship "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_242.wav,51276,with qualitative research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_243.wav,218604,We have also learnt the similarities and differences between the two. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_244.wav,211564,We have also appreciated the importance of the qualitative method of research by way 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_245.wav,136044,of illustrative examples. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_246.wav,229164,"To conclude, the qualitative research as explained above can give meaningful insights and suggestions "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_247.wav,160684,to the information that is scattered everywhere. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_248.wav,253772,It gives us concrete results and indications by performing statistical analysis by converting 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_249.wav,135756,the information into numerical formulas. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_250.wav,166444,The quantitative research has its own merits vis-à-vis qualitative research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_9_Quatitative_Research_251.wav,50252,Thank you!  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_0.wav,205164, Welcome! This is the module on  ‘Sampling’ in research methodology - course law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_1.wav,205164,"So, we are studying research methodology in which we are going to study legal research.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_2.wav,212844,"Law, as we all know, affects a society. Law emanates from the society. Therefore, law cannot be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_3.wav,168972,"and should not be studied in isolation from the society. In such terms, we also can say "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_4.wav,202316,"legal research cannot be conducted in isolation from the society. Now, society is composed "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_5.wav,200044,"of a large number of people in diverse forms, so there are many, many people who are included "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_6.wav,32044,in the society. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_7.wav,226924,They compose the society and they are all diversified. Legal research is coupled with 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_8.wav,278412,"sociology to give rise to socio-legal research. In socio-legal research, we study the doctrinal "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_9.wav,224076,principles of law as it affects the society and the sociological dynamics or societal 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_10.wav,178604,"dynamics as we might like to call it. Now, where there are a large number of people and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_11.wav,200684,"we need to conduct the study on them, we cannot be restricted to just books, we have to go "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_12.wav,189804,"out into the field, we have to interact with the people, we have to observe their behavior, etcetera. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_13.wav,168972,"So in some ways, we can say that we have to have a interdisciplinary approach for legal research.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_14.wav,267916,Here is where sampling comes into play. Sampling is the process of drawing out 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_15.wav,230444,a sample from a large population. So a population is composed of a certain number of people 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_16.wav,179564,and from that certain number of people we draw out a smaller proportion and we call 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_17.wav,147212,"that a sample. So, if we have to study the whole population, it may take a lot of time, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_18.wav,186956,plus it is going to be very cumbersome and not to mention it is also going to be expensive. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_19.wav,203244,"If we take a sample and we follow a particular technique, the laid-down techniques to draw "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_20.wav,159372,"out that sample, we will be able to come up with a representational sample which will "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_21.wav,182156,"be a, we can say a mini mirror image of the whole population. Therefore, sampling is a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_22.wav,178892,very important tool in legal research and we cannot do without it especially in socio-legal 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_23.wav,234604,research where we have to deal with population which is as I said large number of people. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_24.wav,174796,Now there are various terms which are associated with sampling. The first and foremost as I 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_25.wav,250252,"keep saying is population. Population also is conterminously used as universe, that is, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_26.wav,254444,it is synonymously used as universe. Universe is the entire body of people or the entire 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_27.wav,238124,"body of population that is sought to be studied. So, if we are taking up a social legal research "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_28.wav,208684,"and we have, we are wanting to study a particular trait in a particular group of people, we "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_29.wav,145324,"would call that group of people, let it be ten in number, hundred in number, thousand "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_30.wav,132524,"or a lac, we will call that group of people as universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_31.wav,234956,We have to choose our universe very proficiently according to what is our objective of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_32.wav,264684,"So our objective of research basically steers our universe, the selection of our universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_33.wav,246444,"Now, universe may be of different kinds. One kind is based upon the size of the universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_34.wav,155884,"There are two classifications, one classification is upon the size of the universe, the other "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_35.wav,159404,classification is upon the consistency or the homogeneity of the universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_36.wav,193964,"So, let's take up the first classification. In the first classification, we see that universe "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_37.wav,229804,"may be of two kinds. One is finite universe, another is infinite universe. Finite universe "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_38.wav,226316,"is that universe in which the number of people is countable, it can be calculated or it can "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_39.wav,199692,"at least be seen, we can make a list of how many people are there in that particular universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_40.wav,155244,"In infinite universe, we will not be able to, it is unfathomable, so we will not be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_41.wav,190764,able to calculate or compute how many people are included in that universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_42.wav,200364,"Now to explain that, I would like to take an example, infinite universe would be if "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_43.wav,151084,"we are conducting a study on a whole country. So, let’s say a researcher wants to conduct "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_44.wav,168684,a study in the whole of India and let us say the researcher wants to conduct the study 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_45.wav,200044,"on teenagers living in India. Now just imagine there are so many teenagers living in India, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_46.wav,135084,"some of them might be going to school, some of them might not be going to school, some "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_47.wav,130924,"others may be physically challenged, there may be others who may be mentally challenged, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_48.wav,119724,and some others may be who are involved in some kind of labour. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_49.wav,208972,So there are so many categories in teenagers itself and it is unfathomable to keep a count 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_50.wav,177676,"of how many people, how many teenagers are there in India. In such a scenario, we would "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_51.wav,194924,say that the researcher is researching on an infinite universe. The other kind is finite 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_52.wav,213772,"universe, as I said, in that the number of people is limited, so we can calculate it. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_53.wav,157196,"For example, the same researcher wants to conduct a study on teenagers studying in the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_54.wav,207084,"schools and in a particular city, so he has limited the number of people that he wants to study. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_55.wav,220524,"Now, another classification that we were talking about is on the basis of homogeneity or the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_56.wav,227564,consistency of the elements in the universe. Universe is composed of certain units and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_57.wav,218924,"every unit has certain features, every unit may have diverse features from each other. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_58.wav,216684,"So, where the units are displaying similar cha… characteristics or similar features, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_59.wav,184332,we say that the universe is homogenous and where the characteristics displayed by the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_60.wav,236556,"units are not similar to each other, we say that the universe is heterogeneous. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_61.wav,189164,Homogeneity and heterogeneity of universe does not necessarily depend upon the qualitative 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_62.wav,220844,"features, it may also be in numbers. For example, a researcher wants to conduct a study in the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_63.wav,243564,"state of Delhi and in the state of Delhi he has identified certain pockets of areas, so "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_64.wav,202892,"he has taken district one, district two, district three. For example, in district one he sees "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_65.wav,182124,"that there are fifty families living, in district two there are only twenty five families living, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_66.wav,159436,"let’s say because it is more of a commercial area and in district three, there might be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_67.wav,62444,hundred and fifty families living. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_68.wav,186604,"So, he has taken three different pockets and those three different pockets are having different "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_69.wav,193324,"number of people, so we kil… we would call it a heterogeneous universe because the number "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_70.wav,230412,"of people is diverse. In short, homogeneity and heterogeneity of a universe depends not "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_71.wav,207756,"only upon the characteristics displayed by the units, but also upon the number in which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_72.wav,164844,the units are present. We would discuss all this in detail in the sampling techniques. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_73.wav,168332,"Now, another important aspect of sampling is the sampling unit, which I just mentioned. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_74.wav,265068,A unit is the most primary or the most basic part of the universe. It is the thing which 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_75.wav,289932,"is composing the universe, so let us say a person wants to conduct a study in a school "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_76.wav,180844,"on the students, so the students would be the units in the universe and why we call "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_77.wav,169644,it a sampling unit? Is because ultimately the units are supposed to be included in a 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_78.wav,173804,"sampling, I am sorry, in a sample and that is why they are called as a sampling unit. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_79.wav,193964,So now we know that the universe is there and we have to conduct a study on the universe 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_80.wav,222124,"and we know now that the universe is composed of sampling units, but how do we decide which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_81.wav,173164,"of these units will become a part of the sample? For that, we need to identify what is known "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_82.wav,221164,"as a sampling trait. So, now let us come to understand what do you mean by a trait.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_83.wav,171564,"Every researcher, every socio-legal researcher when he is beginning his research, he has certain "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_84.wav,224044,research questions in his mind or he may have some hypothesis in his research proposal. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_85.wav,183084,He needs to identify what are the parameters which he wants to study in the population 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_86.wav,207084,and all those parameters or characteristics as we make call it or features of the population 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_87.wav,284844,"will be the sampling traits. So, for example, a researcher wants to study about drug abuse "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_88.wav,184044,"among teenage students in a school. So, what would be his sampling trait? His sampling "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_89.wav,205484,trait would obviously be those children or those parents whose children are into drug 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_90.wav,100844,abuse or have been in the past into drug abuse. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_91.wav,248364,"So, the sampling trait is the feature which the researcher wants to study in the universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_92.wav,254764,And the sampling trait is what defines whether a sampling unit or rather a unit of the universe 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_93.wav,148204,would become a part of the sample or not. Although there are more technicalities involved 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_94.wav,169644,which you will see further but for now we need to understand that a sampling trait is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_95.wav,148844,one of the primary things that a researcher needs to identify in the universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_96.wav,225644,"Now, the next thing that the researcher needs to see is called as target population.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_97.wav,193964,What is target pop… population? Let us understand that. As I already told you that the units 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_98.wav,175404,of the universe may not all be same. Some of the uni… units of the universe may be 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_99.wav,128684,displaying what we are calling as sampling traits and others may not be displaying the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_100.wav,229164,sampling traits. So in case the units that are displaying the sampling traits are a fixed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_101.wav,216684,"number, we say that that particular part of the universe becomes the target population. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_102.wav,255724,"So, in other words, the target population is what we are going to get once we filter "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_103.wav,200044,"out those units that are not required by us, that wou… that are wasteful for us as a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_104.wav,189484,"researcher. So, once we have the target population, we know that this is the universe that we "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_105.wav,222764,want to study. Let me again elaborate this point about target population by taking the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_106.wav,278124,"example of the study on drug abuse. So, this researcher, for example, has a study proposed "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_107.wav,95404,for drug abuse among teenage children in schools. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_108.wav,213164,"Let us take, for example, that he wants to conduct the study in the Delhi region, in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_109.wav,226604,"the N C R region of Noida. So, obviously, he will be talking to students who are studying "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_110.wav,223724,"in the Noida schools, number one. Number two, those students must be or must have been in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_111.wav,208044,"the past, they must have been facing drug abuse. Now another question to be taken into "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_112.wav,232044,mind is that these children or these students may not be very honest with the responses 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_113.wav,123884,that the researcher is wanting to ask. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_114.wav,151404,So in that case the researcher would like to talk to the parents of such children and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_115.wav,202924,"and the school authorities where such children are studying. Next, the researcher can also "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_116.wav,201324,talk to counselors who are attached with such schools. So now what do we get? We get the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_117.wav,256684,"target population that are showing the sampling trait. So, the universe basically is not only "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_118.wav,166764,"composed or it cannot be demarcated by a geographical area. There are certain questions, there are "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_119.wav,176684,certain considerations that are to be kept in mind when we are demarcating universe universe 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_120.wav,261484,and when we are trying to figure out which is our target population in the universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_121.wav,193964,Now an important thing that next comes to our mind is the sample size. The sample size 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_122.wav,241964,as the name suggests is the size of the sample that we are actually trying to draw out from 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_123.wav,197164,the universe. There there might be a possibility that the sample may be biased sample. In such 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_125.wav,206124,at all. How can we assure that? We can assure that by following the techniques that we have 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_126.wav,87724,formed for our sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_127.wav,215084,"Now, let us try to understand what kind of errors can be there when we are doing samplings. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_128.wav,259244,"Obviously, no human action is without an error, so is sampling. In sampling, there might be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_129.wav,201324,errors that are caused due to sampling or not due to sampling. The errors that are associated 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_130.wav,170924,"with sampling itself are called as sampling errors, and those errors that are not associated "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_131.wav,140844,with sampling are called obviously as non-sampling errors. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_132.wav,219564,Sampling errors are caused due to inappropriate use of technique or using a technique which 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_133.wav,183724,is not suitable for that particular problem. As I have already told you that when we are 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_134.wav,219244,"drawing out a sample from the universe, we need to see that the sampling technique that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_135.wav,252844,"we have employed is according to the research objective of our research. So, if we follow "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_136.wav,185964,"that sincerely, we will not get a biased sample, I am sorry, we will not have a sampling error. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_137.wav,184364,But in case we do not and we randomly select any sampling technique without understanding 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_138.wav,137644,"what is our objective of research and what kind of sample size do we want from the universe, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_139.wav,258924,we might end up with a sampling error. Non-sampling errors are those errors that are associated 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_140.wav,205164,"not with sampling. For example, these are the errors that may occur during data analysis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_141.wav,197484,"or data collection or even while the formation of research design, so one has to take care. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_142.wav,208684,"But all in all, sampling errors as well as non-sampling errors, they all cumulatively "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_143.wav,206764,"affect the study results. So, what is the need of sampling? We have been studying, we "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_144.wav,124844,"have been reading sampling, what is the need of sampling? The first and foremost need of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_145.wav,246444,sampling is that it gives us accuracy of results. Now you may wonder that we have a universe 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_146.wav,182764,"to study which is a huge amount of people, a particular group of population and we have "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_147.wav,163244,"taken only a small amount of population from it to study in lieu of the universe, then "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_148.wav,48364,how can the results be accurate? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_149.wav,218284,"Well, the answer is very simple. The larger the amount of data to be calculated or computed, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_150.wav,145964,the more are the chances of some mistakes happening because as I already said it is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_151.wav,281324,only human to make mistakes. Accuracy of results is obtained because we have taken a representative 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_152.wav,159404,sample from the entire body of population or the entire body of universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_153.wav,159724,"While doing that we have made sure, we have applied the techniques in such a way that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_154.wav,235564,we have made sure that the sample is displaying the characteristics of the universe and it 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_155.wav,278124,"is displaying the number of people in a proportionate manner. In such a way, we can deduce the results "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_156.wav,234604,"from the sample itself and we can generalize those results to the universe. So, obviously "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_157.wav,199084,this is one important aspect of doing sampling so that we do not have to conduct the study 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_158.wav,62124,on the whole universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_159.wav,195244,The second important thing is it is time efficient because imagine that you have to conduct a 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_160.wav,239084,"study on the whole of the India, so that would obviously be very time consuming and it would "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_161.wav,279404,take a lot of efforts. Conducting a study on a sample reduces time by a lot of times. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_162.wav,213164,"Thirdly, it is cost effective. Conducting a study on the universe as compared to conducting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_163.wav,133484,a study on a sample is but logically more expensive. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_164.wav,224012,"So, when we have to conduct a study on a huge group of population, we will obviously prefer "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_165.wav,174764,"that we spend some more time and we understand the technicalities of sampling and therefore, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_166.wav,234316,"we reduce our cost. After all, research work is to be sponsored by our own self if we are "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_167.wav,194572,"not going to a research institute for it. Most importantly, the need of sampling is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_168.wav,95116,because it is convenient to do sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_169.wav,206764,"When we apply the techniques of sampling, we are able to come up with a sample, which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_170.wav,242924,"is a mini representation of the universe. While doing that, we are basically studying "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_171.wav,187212,the universe but in a more convenient manner. We will still have a large number of people 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_172.wav,230796,"to study, yet it will be lesser as compared to the whole of the population. Now, let us "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_173.wav,177932,"understand what is the next step in sampling, which is sampling design. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_174.wav,211244,"Just as you all must have known when we are conducting research, the very first step is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_175.wav,210636,"to make a research design. Research design is nothing but the guiding path, the guiding "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_176.wav,231084,"light for our research, in a similar way sampling design is nothing but a pathfinder for our "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_177.wav,169932,"sampling processes. So, what all things are there in the sampling design? The first and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_178.wav,217324,foremost thing that is there is the objective of study. The objective of our research is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_179.wav,212236,the thing that guides us right from the time of formulation of research problem to the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_180.wav,96364,time we are writing our research report. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_181.wav,187212,"So, objective of study has to be kept in mind while making the sampling design, when we "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_182.wav,175084,"are beginning with sampling, just prior to that we should sit at one place and try to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_183.wav,207116,figure out what exactly is the objective of our study or what are the objectives of our 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_184.wav,188492,"study because that will as you will further see, that will be very important in understanding "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_185.wav,170636,or in finding out which is the appropriate sampling technique for our study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_186.wav,207052,"The second thing is about universe, we have to clearly define our universe. We have to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_187.wav,210604,"clearly know what all traits do we want in the universe, so we should know what are our "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_188.wav,206796,"sampling units and what all sampling units are composed, I am sorry included in the universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_189.wav,254124,"So, next step is to define the universe very clearly. Third step would be to have a sample "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_190.wav,209644,"size. Now, once we have the universe we can easily come to know or we can easily decide "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_191.wav,87404,what kind of sample size do we want. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_192.wav,210604,"Now, how can that be done? Sample size is something which has to be proportional to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_193.wav,201644,the universe. We cannot have a sample size which is which is just fifty percent of the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_194.wav,119372,universe or we cannot have a sample size which is just two percent of the universe.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_195.wav,290604,"In other words, a sample should not be too big nor should it be too small. It has to be sufficient "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_196.wav,237804,in number so that it represents all the characteristics present in the universe proportionately. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_197.wav,171596,Next thing that we need to note down are the population parameters which are nothing but 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_198.wav,229484,"the vital statistics of the population. For example, census figures or gender ratio, etcetera. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_199.wav,225004,These parameters will help us to understand what kind of universe are we working on and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_200.wav,257004,these parameters will also help us to understand what kind of sample size will we be getting. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_201.wav,144332,Next thing which according to me is a very important step in individual researches is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_202.wav,237196,budgetary and time constraints. Budgetary constraints means we need to plan out our 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_203.wav,214092,"expenses, we have to predict what kind of expenditure would we be incurring in the sampling, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_204.wav,190156,while doing sampling as well as after the sampling is done and we have a sample in our hand. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_205.wav,262732," We have to predict those expenditure and we need to also time our whole schedule, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_206.wav,271724,so we need to have a timeframe within which we must focus and we must stick to that time schedule. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_207.wav,141836,So budgetary and time constraints or budgetary and time schedules are something that we need 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_208.wav,176044,to plan ahead so that we do not go out of bound neither in terms of money nor in terms 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_209.wav,224044,of time. Next thing which is the thing that we are going to study next is the sampling technique.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_210.wav,193324,So what do you mean by a sampling technique? Sampling techniques are those techniques 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_211.wav,172812,that are used to carve out a sample from the universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_212.wav,145676,Universe is composed of many units as I have already told you and we need to carve out 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_213.wav,185932,a sample from it in such a manner that it becomes a mini mirror image of the whole universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_214.wav,165484,"Now, what kind of sampling technique is to be used depends upon the sampling technique "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_215.wav,174764,"as well as the universe. That is to say, we need to first and foremost find out what kind "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_216.wav,187596,"of universe are we working on, that is what is the nature of the units in our universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_217.wav,223084,On the basis of that we need to see what kind of sampling technique would we be using. Every 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_218.wav,120044,"technique has its own salient features, every technique has its disadvantages, advantages, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_219.wav,197772,as well as every technique has its suitability to a particular kind of universe or to a particular 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_220.wav,245836,"kind of study. Now, these sampling techniques basically are the method by which we are able "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_221.wav,138572,to carve out a sample from the whole universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_222.wav,176364,"Every unit does not stand a chance of becoming a part of the sample, there are only few units "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_223.wav,214476,"which stand a chance of becoming part of the universe. Now, depending upon the likelihood "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_224.wav,271084,"of a unit to be included in the sample, sampling techniques are classified into three kinds. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_225.wav,220204,"One is probability sampling, another is non-probability sampling, third is mixed sampling. Probability "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_226.wav,209612,"sampling as the name suggests is full of probabilities, well, it is not full of probabilities as much "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_227.wav,162636,as it gives a lot of probability to each and every unit in the universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_228.wav,220204,"In other words, all the units in the universe stand an equal chance of being included in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_229.wav,225612,"the sample when we are doing probability sampling. So, probability sampling is not a sampling "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_230.wav,161996,"technique in itself, it is only a classification, but whichever techniques come under the head "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_231.wav,252844,"of probability sampling will be, will be sampling from the universe in such a way that all the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_232.wav,167084,uni… units in the universe will stand at an equal chance of being included in the sample. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_233.wav,124204,"So, obviously it is a very unbiased kind of sampling. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_234.wav,191724,Second is non-probability sampling which is the kind of sampling technique in which all 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_235.wav,169612,the units do not stand an equal chance of being represented in the sample or being included 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_236.wav,183116,"in the sample. In fact, in some techniques none of the units stand a chance of being "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_237.wav,147884,"included in the sample. We would look at that very soon. Third is mixed sampling, well, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_238.wav,152044,there are some sampling techniques which are neither purely probability sampling nor purely 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_239.wav,64044,non-probability sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_240.wav,184044,In such cases or such sampling techniques are basically then kept under the third head 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_241.wav,162892,which is the mixed sampling. A lot of sampling techniques that we are going to see will form 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_242.wav,224748,"under a head of mixed sampling. Now, let us have a look at the sampling techniques. First "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_243.wav,219500,"and foremost, we will see the easiest sampling technique which is called as simple random sampling. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_244.wav,193356,"Simple random sampling, as the name suggests, is doing of or conducting of sampling in a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_245.wav,139244,very random fashion and it is very simple because it has no technicalities.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_246.wav,265004,"Simple random sampling has only one prerequisite, you need to have a list of all the units in the universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_247.wav,208364,"So, let's say you are conducting a study on some number of houses or some number of families "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_248.wav,194252,"in a particular locality, you need to have a list of all the houses in the locality. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_249.wav,170284,Now simple random sampling is nothing but the choice of the researcher. The researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_250.wav,190476,can randomly pick up any loca… any house or family that he wants to study and he can 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_251.wav,246412,include it in the sample. Simple random sampling is completely the researcher’s choice that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_252.wav,201004,the researcher wants to randomly select or he wants to use a particular system in selecting 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_253.wav,222124,or he wants to blindly do it or he may ask a child to do it or he may ask his own supervisor to do it.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_254.wav,136076,So it is completely the choice of the researcher what kind of method does he 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_255.wav,111724,want to use for doing the simple random sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_256.wav,181772,The most popular methods of simple random sampling are Lottery and Tippet’s Table. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_257.wav,154956,"Lottery, as the name suggest, is a blind method of doing simple random sampling. So all you "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_258.wav,202924,"need to do for doing the, using the lottery method is to make a list of all the units "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_259.wav,180844,present in the universe as I already said. You name them or you give them a number and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_260.wav,110124,you write all the numbers on small chits of paper. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_261.wav,251852,"You put the chits away, you put them together and probably shake them and either you yourself "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_262.wav,165196,"pick out the number of the, requisite number of units that you want because you have already "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_263.wav,193964,decided the sample size or you can ask anyone else to do that for you. So whatever units 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_264.wav,220172,"you will have in your hand will be your sample. Now, this has no technicality. However, there "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_265.wav,189196,is a disadvantage because it may not be representing the universe proportionately or adequately. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_266.wav,189164,"So, it is the researcher’s choice what is a sample size that he wants to do and what "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_267.wav,181132,kind of units will he be picking up is completely the luck of the researcher I would say.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_268.wav,167756,Another popular method that came up after the use of lottery method was Tippet’s Table.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_269.wav,173452,"Now researchers had realized during, using the lottery method that it was a method which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_270.wav,180204,"required a lot of time. It was a time when they were no computers, so manually listing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_271.wav,244556,all the units in the universe and then putting them away in a blind lottery would be a lot of work. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_272.wav,205164,"So, lot many research scholars and researches came up with some tables of random numbers, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_273.wav,219564,Tippet was one of them. He came up with a table of ten thousand four hundred numbers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_274.wav,188844,"These all all of these numbers are numbers of four digits, so he just put them in a table "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_275.wav,227244,and what we need to do when we use the Tippet’s Table is this. We assign all our units of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_276.wav,167404,"the universe four digits number, so let’s say a researcher wants to conduct a study "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_277.wav,196524,on nine hundred units and he needs a sample size of let’s say five hundred people. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_278.wav,124204,"So, what he will do is to these, because nine hundred is a three digit number, so what he "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_279.wav,159436,will do is all these nine hundred people will be assigned a four digit number from let’s 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_280.wav,208332,say three thousand to three thousand nine hundred and then he will randomly in the Tippet’s 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_281.wav,173452,"Table pick up any four digit number, any four digit number which falls between three thousand "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_282.wav,209004,to three thousand nine hundred and then onwards he will simply take up those numbers that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_283.wav,190764,are given in the table and he will go ahead and keep selecting the units in the universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_284.wav,158476,"This way, he will not, the researcher will not have to use any technicality in selecting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_285.wav,170604,"the units and it will not be, there will not be any personal bias of the researcher in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_286.wav,241292,"selecting the units, plus there will not be, it will, it is a very simple method of doing sampling.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_287.wav,203244,"However, it is very random and again just like in lottery method there is the disadvantage "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_288.wav,188844,that the sample that is collected may not be adequately representing the universe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_289.wav,196876,"So, now let us look at other sampling techniques. One of them is interval sampling, which is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_290.wav,186252,"a higher form of simple random sampling, why? Because it is again random, but it is more "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_291.wav,229516,systematic. Interval sampling is nothing but selecting units from the universe in an interval 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_292.wav,171884,or after a particular interval. What that interval will be is completely to the researcher’s 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_293.wav,245484,"choice. So, let’s say the researcher wants to select a sample size of twenty people and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_294.wav,87724,he has a universe of two hundred people. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_295.wav,206412,"So, let’s say the research says that my interval is going to be ten and he makes a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_296.wav,135084,list of all the units in the universe and he randomly picks up any number.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_297.wav,230796,"Let's say he has picked up the number eleven, after that he is going to, after interval of ten "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_298.wav,199724,"people he is going to select the units. So, he will have a sample size, the desired sample "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_299.wav,165132,size that he wants and he will not have to use any technicality. Plus there will be no 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_300.wav,70796,personal bias of the researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_301.wav,212524,"However, this kind of sampling is not very useful in heterogeneous universe because in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_302.wav,208972,"heterogeneous universe different characteristics, diverse characteristics are are present in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_303.wav,233324,"the universe. So, let us look at another sampling, another kind of sampling that we can see or "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_304.wav,201964,we can conduct is stratified sampling. Stratified sampling as the name suggests is a sampling 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_305.wav,210956,in which the population or the universe is divided into strata. It is a method which 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_306.wav,223052,is very useful for those population which are heterogeneous in quality. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_307.wav,185356,These kind of universe which are heterogeneous in quality and which can be divided into homogeneous 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_308.wav,216364,"strata, so there might be a population which can be divided into different strata and each "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_309.wav,200972,"strata should have homogeneous quality with each other. Now, what the researcher will "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_310.wav,173484,do? He will draw out samples from each of the strata using any of the other sampling 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_311.wav,193676,techniques that he may like. The final sample which is composed of all the samples from 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_312.wav,160044,"the, from each of the strata will be the one that he will be studying finally. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_313.wav,203244,"Stratified sampling can be conducted in two ways- one is proportional, another is simple. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_314.wav,181132,"In simple stratified sampling, as we see, as I have already told you, the researcher "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_315.wav,260524,"simply selects from the, simply selects sampling units from the strata, each of the stratum "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_316.wav,176684,"and in proportional stratified sampling, the researcher makes sure that the proportion "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_317.wav,213836,in which the stratum is present in the universe is the same in which the units from that particular 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_318.wav,196204,"stratum are present in the sample, so that is what is called as proportional stratified sampling. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_319.wav,292524,"It is more technical. However, it ensures that the researcher will get a more proportionate sample.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_320.wav,232364,"Now, next is purposive sampling. Purposive sampling, also known as judgment sampling, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_321.wav,231084,is entirely the researcher’s choice. The researcher is at complete free will to select 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_322.wav,206732,any of the units that stand a chance of being included in the sample. None of the units 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_323.wav,140844,which are in the sample or none of the units which are in the universe stand a chance of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_324.wav,169036,being included in the sample because it is completely the researcher’s choice. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_325.wav,182412,Researcher out of his convenience or within his convenience may choose any unit that he 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_326.wav,271084,he likes. It is very useful in those researches in which qualitative investigations are to be done. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_327.wav,252204,It is not very useful in empirical analysis. Why? Because it may not be representative 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_328.wav,232684,"in character, the sample that you finally get may not be very representative of the entire universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_329.wav,145356,Another one is convenient sampling which should not be confused with purposive sampling because 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_330.wav,193324,in convenient sampling also the researcher himself chooses which kind of units he wants 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_331.wav,215084,"to select as sample. However, there is a major difference in purposive and convenient sampling. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_332.wav,232044,"In purposive sampling, it does not matter whether the the unit is convenient for the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_333.wav,152044,"researcher to use or not. But in convenient sampling, the researcher accesses or uses "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_334.wav,178604,any of the units that are convenient or that are in front of him to be included in the sample. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_335.wav,242924,"Now all the units that are convenient to access may be included in the sample, but one advantage "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_336.wav,181484,of this sampling is that there is no need to have a prior list of all the units in the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_337.wav,221164,universe. It is a very inexpensive method which makes it very popular among the researchers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_338.wav,136684,"However, convenient sampling cannot be used in empirical researches, it could be used "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_339.wav,69804,in qualitative researches. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_340.wav,194604,"Let's take for example, a company which has launched a new product in the market wants "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_341.wav,155884,"to know what is the response of the public for that particular product. So, that company "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_342.wav,294124,will access any of the people that it wants to or it is coming across any place where 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_343.wav,184044,"the product is being sold, the company will take the responses or will take the feedback "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_344.wav,209324,from those people. Another important kind of sampling that is done is cluster sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_345.wav,203564,Cluster sampling means that kind of sampling in which the universe is divided into clusters. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_346.wav,210604,"Now, we studied stratified sampling and we saw that the universe was divided into strata, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_347.wav,192364,but in stratified sampling the researcher himself was dividing the universe into different 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_348.wav,200044,"stratum. In cluster sampling, the clusters are already available or they are already "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_349.wav,211564,"made in the universe. To take a very simple example, let's say a researcher wants to conduct "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_350.wav,110444,a study in an educational institution or a university. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_351.wav,175724,"Now, there are various departments that are existing in the university. So, those departments "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_352.wav,146604,will have various employees. Let's say the researcher wants to conduct a study on the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_353.wav,244204,"women employees, so each of the department will form a cluster. Now the researcher will "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_354.wav,155564,take into consideration all the clusters and he will draw out the samples from each of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_355.wav,100524,"the clusters, that is one way of doing it. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_356.wav,201644,"Another way of doing it is that sampling may be done in multiple phases, that is to say, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_357.wav,237484,"the researcher has already, the researcher has already taken out the samples from each "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_358.wav,191084,"of the cluster and he has studied them, then he further goes into the sample, into the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_359.wav,210924,cluster and takes out or draws out sample from them to conduct the study. Another kind 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_360.wav,113964,of sampling which is very important is sequential sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_361.wav,212204,"It is a very convenient form of sampling which is also called as snowball sampling. So, sequential "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_362.wav,190764,sampling and snowball sampling may be used synonymously. What is snowball sampling? It 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_363.wav,236844,means that kind of sampling in which you just simply go on processing or go on collecting 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_364.wav,184364,"the data and as you go on collecting the data, you are forming the sample. So, sequential "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_365.wav,273324,sampling is more or less a very ongoing process. It does not end. Let us say this kind of sampling 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_366.wav,46764,is used basically. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_367.wav,197164,In those kind of scenarios in which the respondents may be a hidden community or they may not 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_368.wav,189484,"be very outgoing community or respondents may not be very outgoing in the responses, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_369.wav,183084,"etcetera. So, in such cases the universe may be undefined or may be very ambiguous and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_370.wav,217004,"in such scenarios, it is it is desirable that the researcher takes help of sequential sampling. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_371.wav,234924,"So, for example, a researcher wants to conduct study in a red light area for prostitutes "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_372.wav,172204,and let's say the researcher wants to study whether the right to education is being given 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_373.wav,198764,or he wants to assess that what is the access to the R T E for the children of prostitutes. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_374.wav,176364,Such kind of places or such kind of people may not be very responsive and it may be difficult 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_375.wav,197804,to clearly define the universe for such studies. In such scenarios sequential sampling is a 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_376.wav,85164,very useful form of sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_377.wav,214444,"Another sampling that is very important is quota sampling. In quota sampling, we decide "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_378.wav,175084,"characteristics on the basis of which we divide the whole population. So, let's say the researcher "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_379.wav,265644,"wants to conduct a study for different age groups of men as well as women. So, he has "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_380.wav,258284,"taken into consideration let's say age group of zero to fifteen and sixteen to thirty, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_381.wav,228204,"then thirty one to let’s say forty, these are the kind of age groups that he has taken into consideration. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_382.wav,236844,"Now, he will divide whole of the population into those age groups, each of the age groups "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_383.wav,176364,"will be called one quota. Further, he will divide those age groups or those quotas into "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_384.wav,176044,"men and women because that is the classification that the researcher wants. In such scenarios, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_385.wav,162284,"he will have a particular number of people from each of the quota, so there might be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_386.wav,217004,"X number of men in one age group, Y number of men in another age group, A number of women "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_387.wav,113964,"in one age group, B number of women in another age group. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_388.wav,235564,"This kind of quota sampling is very helpful for in-depth investigation. Now, he will calculate "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_389.wav,203564,"the proportion of each category to the universe, that is how many men in a particular age group "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_390.wav,241964,are represented in the universe and in the same proportion he will take out the sample 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_391.wav,190444,"from the universe from that particular quota. So, quota sampling is a very effective sampling "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_392.wav,290284,"because units from each category proportionately represent that particular quota, that particular category. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_393.wav,189484,"Now, another important kind of sampling is volunteer sampling, which is also a very easy "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_394.wav,140524,"going sampling I would say, because volunteer sampling, as the name suggest, is the kind "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_395.wav,193644,"of sampling in which the researcher himself volunteers to be a part of the sampling, so "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_396.wav,275244,"he himself will be participating in the research as a… So, he himself will be participating "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_397.wav,150124,in the research as a volunteer or as a participant. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_398.wav,134124,"His his own data will be collected by his own self, so don't you think there is going "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_399.wav,209964,"to be some form of personal bias? Yes, the answer is yes. So, volunteer sampling is not "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_400.wav,181164,"a very desirable sampling. However, in some scenarios, it is very useful because the the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_401.wav,228844,"researcher may be having some kind of inputs which will be useful for his own study, plus "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_402.wav,144364,"if he is doing the research ethically and he is honest and genuine in his research, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_403.wav,192044,the inputs can be used and can be put to good use in the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_404.wav,197484,Another important kind of sampling is multi-stage sampling. Multi-stage sampling means sampling 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_405.wav,255436,"which is conducted at multiple stages. Now, what happens is in multiple sampling we take "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_406.wav,173132,"a particular universe, we divide it into different categories of, we divide it into different "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_407.wav,211884,"areas, ok . That is one kind of sampling. We have already divided into let's say clusters, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_408.wav,201964,"ok . So, we have done cluster sampling at one stage, in each of the clusters we will "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_409.wav,59884,further do some other sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_410.wav,187884,"Let's say we are doing stratified sampling. In each of the strata, we are further doing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_411.wav,165164,"some more sampling, let's say sequential sampling or if not sequential sampling, let’s say "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_412.wav,206124,"interval sampling. And in the that, the smaller number of sample that we have now in each "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_413.wav,227884,"of the different clusters, we are further conducting sequential sampling and that particular "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_414.wav,249644,"final sample will be the one that will be, that we will be using as a as a sample for our universe. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_415.wav,195564,Now multistage sampling is done in those scenarios where we have a huge population which is divisible 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_416.wav,177324,"into clusters. I will give a very small example to make this understand. So, let’s say we, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_417.wav,161004,a researcher or a research organization wants to conduct a particular study in the country 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_418.wav,153004,"of India. The first thing that they do is they divide the country into clusters. Now, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_419.wav,172844,"we have north zone, south zone, west zone and east zone. So, there are four clusters. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_420.wav,206444,"In each of the clusters, they may do let's say stratified sampling, so the the, let’s "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_421.wav,200364,"say we, let’s assume that the researcher wants to conduct the study and one of his "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_422.wav,223724,"sampling traits is also geography. So, he will divide each of the clusters, within the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_423.wav,167724,clusters he will divide the clusters on the basis of the geographical conditions into 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_424.wav,262444,"different strata. In each of the strata, the researcher or the researchers may further "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_425.wav,130284,do purposive sampling or interval sampling. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_426.wav,238764,"So, in other words, the sampling is conducted at different stages and it goes down to a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_427.wav,189484,"very small number of samples, but it is done in such a way which is very technical and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_428.wav,231084,"it is very organized. Therefore, the proportionality may be a question because after all we are "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_429.wav,198444,"going from a huge population to a very small number of people. It may be, the proportionality "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_430.wav,212204,"may be a question, however, because we have done sampling at multiple stages so representativeness "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_431.wav,94124,may not be that big a question. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_432.wav,169324,"Multiphase sampling is another twin brother of multi-stage sampling, the only difference "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_433.wav,200044,"between multiphase and multi-stage sampling is that, in multiphase sampling the sampling "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_434.wav,228204,"is also done in multiple stages, but at every stage the sample that you get is studied first. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_435.wav,192076,"So, for example, in the example that I gave of India, the clusters that are taken, the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_436.wav,194252,"north, west, south and east zone, each of the clusters will have a particular sample, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_437.wav,187884,"let us say on the basis of strata or let’s say among the clusters, some purposive sampling is done. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_438.wav,192044,"First, a study is conducted on those samples, then the clusters are further sampled into "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_439.wav,180236,"by stratified sampling etcetera. Then the study is conducted on those samples and finally, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_440.wav,183052,finally the samples that you get which we have already discussed in multi-stage sampling 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_441.wav,191084,"that is conducted in the end. So, basically you can have a comparison of samples within "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_442.wav,197484,the universe as well. This is also a very effective method of sampling for in-depth investigation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_443.wav,194604,"Now, we have studied all the sampling techniques, we have understood their salient features, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_444.wav,203564,"we have understood what kind of sampling techniques are used, more useful for some kind of studies "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_445.wav,154604,and what kind of sampling techniques may not be very useful for some other kind of studies. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_446.wav,170604,"However, there are certain principles and precautions of sampling which are common to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_447.wav,54124,all kinds of sampling techniques. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_448.wav,154284,"So, you may take any sampling technique but these principles are to be followed and they "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_449.wav,196844,"have to be adhered to strictly. Most important one is we have to clearly define our universe, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_450.wav,231084,so we need to have a clear definition and a clear demarcation of our universe. We cannot 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_451.wav,261164,have a vague idea or ambiguity so that it would lead to a lot of ambiguities in the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_452.wav,162284,"sample itself, which would lead to ambiguities and errors in the final study results. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_453.wav,188844,"So, a clearly defined universe is the most important thing in sampling. Second thing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_454.wav,170924,is we need to have a well-planned sampling design. Because we are beginning with sampling 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_455.wav,164524,"and we have begun with a guiding light that is a sampling design, we need to be very clear "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_456.wav,197164,"of what our sample size should be, what kind of proportions do we want for the sample from "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_457.wav,272684,the universe. We need to plan for our expenses and we need to stick to our decided timeframe. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_458.wav,183404,"Next is accessibility of respondents- In the sampling design itself, we need to make sure "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_459.wav,148524,that the kind of respondents that we are looking at are accessible or not. In today's times 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_460.wav,163564,"of technological advancements, there are many ways of accessing respondents like email, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_461.wav,209644,"telephone calls, video conferencing, etcetera. But in each of the ways of communication, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_462.wav,133484,we need to make sure that the respondents that we are wanting to or we are seeking the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_463.wav,175084,data collection from are accessible and they are going to respond or not. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_464.wav,197484,Next thing is that the units that are included in the sample must be independent of each other.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_465.wav,179244,They must be distinct from each other and the inclusion of one unit should not be 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_466.wav,157804,"dependent on the inclusion of another unit in the sample, so they must be distinct from "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_467.wav,172844,each other and they must be independent of each other. Next is that the researcher must 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_468.wav,130924,conduct the sampling in an unbiased objective and systematic manner. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_469.wav,170284,"We have studied lot of techniques of sampling till now and we know the, the technicalities "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_470.wav,153004,"of each of those sampling techniques, we know the salient features of those sampling techniques, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_471.wav,129644,"we know the advantages, the disadvantages of those sampling techniques and we also know "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_472.wav,225644,"which universe and which studies are the most use… suitable for. So, we need to know or "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_473.wav,149484,the researcher needs to know that this is the kind of sampling technique that I would 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_474.wav,158124,like to choose and he has to make sure that the universe that he has selected and the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_475.wav,192044,kind of sample size that he wants as well as the objectives of the research of his research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_476.wav,141164,are in tandem or in line with the choice of his sampling technique. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_477.wav,171884,"So, he has to be very objective, he has to be systematic, he has to be organized and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_478.wav,171884,he has to be unbiased as much as possible because the research without value and research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_479.wav,235244,without objectivity is no research at all. Next is that the researcher must avoid arbitrary 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_480.wav,195564,"alteration, so the researcher should not give into that urge of arbitrarily altering altering "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_481.wav,141164,"something. If he has decided something, if he has planned for a sampling design and he "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_482.wav,149164,"has provided for points in the sampling design, he must adhere to those points and he should "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_483.wav,123884,not be lazy in not adhering to those points. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_484.wav,137964,"Sampling errors must be avoided as much as possible, that we have already seen how that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_485.wav,151404,can be done. We need to be very sure of what kind of sampling technique are we looking 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_486.wav,163884,"at, what kind of sampling techniques do we want to use and what kind of sample size are "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_487.wav,172524,we wanting to seek. Next thing is we need to know what kind of data collection are we 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_488.wav,132204,"looking at, what are the respondents from whom we will be collecting data and according "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_489.wav,89964,to that we need to select the sampling technique. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_490.wav,178924,We need to be very unbiased and professional when we are selecting the sample so that our 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_491.wav,182124,own bias does not come into picture and we do not select a wrong sample. A wrongly selected 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_492.wav,240684,sample would in the end affect the study results and it would lead to sampling errors.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_493.wav,201964,"Finally, and definitely not the least important is the objective of the entire research, which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_494.wav,71724,we talked about in the sampling design also. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_495.wav,184044,Objective of the research is the guiding light right from the time when we formulate the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_496.wav,202284,research problem to the time when we are writing the research report and same holds true for sampling also. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_497.wav,119084,"In the process of sampling, we need to constantly remind ourselves or "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_498.wav,215404,the researcher needs to constantly remind himself what is the objective of his research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_499.wav,209644,"Summing up, we read about concept of sampling, we knew about universe, we read about some "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_500.wav,176044,"important terms like universe, population parameters. We read about how universe is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_501.wav,183084,"composed of many units and how those units can be formed into a sample, which is a mini "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_502.wav,163244,representation of the entire universe. We read about the importance of sampling that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_503.wav,213484,why do we not study the whole universe and in lieu of studying the universe we study the sample. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_504.wav,166124,"Next, we studied the sampling design. There are various steps in a sampling design which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_505.wav,174444,need to be followed for preparing a particular design and we need to follow it. If we have 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_506.wav,161324,"a guiding light, we will be able to do our sampling in a very systematic and organized "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_507.wav,197804,"manner. We studied various kinds of sampling techniques. Before that, we read about classification "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_508.wav,124524,"of sampling in probability, non-probability and mixed sampling. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_509.wav,188844,"Thereafter, we did various types of sampling techniques and we study their salient features, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_510.wav,153964,"advantages and disadvantages. Now, we do know that what kind of sampling tech… techniques "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_511.wav,151724,would be more useful for a particular study and for a particular universe. Last but not 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_512.wav,160364,"the least we studied important principles of sampling. In important principles of sampling, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_513.wav,179244,we came across some precautions that the researcher has to always take whether he is making his 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_514.wav,183724,sampling design or he is conducting sampling by using any of the sampling techniques that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_10_Sampling_515.wav,16684,he has studied.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_0.wav,216684,"I am Deepika Prakash from National Law University, Delhi. The topic of this presentation is Data "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_2.wav,262444,"steps that the researcher follows. They are, firstly, the researcher defines a problem. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_3.wav,269804,Then he goes on to review the available literature on that problem. Then he formulates hypothesis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_4.wav,146924,or research questions as the case may be. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_5.wav,211884,"Then he creates a research design, on the basis of this research design he goes on to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_6.wav,262444,further collect data with the help of various tools of data collection. Once the data is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_7.wav,288684,"collected, this data is processed, analyzed and interpreted. And then the final step in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_8.wav,135084,the research is writing of  research report. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_9.wav,246124,Data Analysis is an important step in the entire process of research. Data alone in 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_10.wav,258572,both whether qualitative or qualitative research is insufficient until it is carefully processed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_11.wav,255084,and scientifically analyzed and interpreted. The present presentation deals with only how 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_12.wav,129676,quantitative research data must be analyzed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_13.wav,247404,"Now, coming to the meaning of data analysis. Wilkinson and Bhandarkar defines data analysis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_14.wav,300492,as a number of closely related operations that are performed with the purpose of summarizing 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_15.wav,239756,the collected data and organizing these in such a manner that they will need answers 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_16.wav,283212,to the research questions. Or suggest hypotheses of questions if no such questions or hypothesis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_17.wav,194604,has been there at the initiation of the study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_18.wav,268236,"Another meaning is given by CR Kothari, who explains analysis as computation of certain "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_19.wav,283884,measures along with searching for patterns of relationship that exists among data groups. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_20.wav,278412,"He further goes on to quote G.B. Giles saying that “in the process of analysis, relationships "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_21.wav,249036,"or differences, supporting or conflicting with original or new hypothesis should be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_22.wav,266604,subject to statistical tests of significance to determine with what validity data can be 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_23.wav,120044,set to indicate any conclusion”. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_24.wav,304652,"Now, general understanding is that data analysis, data processing and data interpretation are "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_25.wav,255404,"one and the same. However, this is not true. All these three steps are very distinctive "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_26.wav,260524,"steps in the entire research process. Quoting Professor John Gauing, “processing of data "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_27.wav,251244,"refers to concentrating, recasting and dealing with the data, so that they are as responsive "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_28.wav,249004,"to analysis, while analysis of data refers to seeing the data in the light of hypothesis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_29.wav,275596,of research questions and the prevailing theories and drawing conclusions that are as amenable 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_30.wav,98924,to theory formation as possible”. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_31.wav,250924,"Now, let us go ahead to understand the difference between them. First, that we are going to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_32.wav,252844,"understand is the data processing. There are various steps under data processing, the first "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_33.wav,287724,"step being editing. Under editing, raw data that is collected is checked for errors, omissions, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_34.wav,154604,"legibility, etcetera for further processing. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_35.wav,276524,"The second step under data processing is coding, under it assign numerals or other na,... symbols "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_36.wav,283884,"to the answers is done. So, that responses can be put into a limited number of categories or classes.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_37.wav,287724,"Now, this coding can be pre or post. By pre poding, coding, codes being assigned, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_38.wav,255724,"while the questions or interview schedule is being prepared that is, before thei,... "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_39.wav,172844,"they are prepared, the codes assigned. Whereas, under post coding, codes are assigned to the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_40.wav,140524,answers after they have been collected. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_41.wav,297964,Third step in data processing is classification. Most research studies result in a large volume 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_42.wav,228204,"of raw data, which must be reduced into homogeneous groups. If we are to make a meaningful relationship "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_43.wav,251244,"between them. This fact necessitates classification of data, which happens to be the process of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_44.wav,269484,arranging data in groups or classes on the basis of common characteristics. Data having 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_45.wav,208364,"a common characteristic are placed in one char,... one class and in this way, the entire "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_46.wav,175404,data gets divided into number of groups or classes. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_47.wav,275564,"Now, this classification further, maybe according to attributes or according to class intervals. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_48.wav,256044,"Now, under attributes, they may be based on descriptive characteristics like sex or literacy. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_49.wav,313644,"Or they may be based on numerical characteristics like weight or income. Under a class interval, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_50.wav,240364,classification is based on numerical distinction like the difference in height between five 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_51.wav,178604,"and six feet, the difference of height between six to seven feet, etcetera. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_52.wav,296364,Fourth step under data processing is tabulation. The process of summarizing raw data and displaying 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_53.wav,241644,the same in compact form mainly in the form of statistical tables for further analysis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_54.wav,284524,"is known as tabulation. It makes research manageable, readable and understandable.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_55.wav,145644,"Now, tabulation is essential because of the following reasons. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_56.wav,303724,"First, it conserves space and reduces explanatory and descriptive statements to a minimum.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_57.wav,242604,"Second, it facilitates the process of comparison. Third, it facilitates the summation of items "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_58.wav,313644,"and the detection of error as well as a omissions. Fourth, it provides the basis for various "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_59.wav,33324,statistical computation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_60.wav,283884,"Now, there are two types of table. First is a simple or also known as frequency distribution "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_61.wav,256364,"and second table is a complex or cross table. Now, coming to simple table under it the different "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_62.wav,186924,attributes are stated in the left hand column and the frequency or the extent of occurrence 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_64.wav,264684,"First, the class made must be mutually exclusive. Second, the tabulation must have internal "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_65.wav,241644,"logic and order, and three, the class interval must be carefully and reasonably selected. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_67.wav,94124,"In this table, the variant is age. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_68.wav,196876,"Coming to the next type of table, the complex table. Following is an example of a complex "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_69.wav,255372,"table by a multi variant table. They have more than one variable. As in this example, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_70.wav,204876,income and sex of the population studied are the variables. These tables have become more 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_71.wav,119404,popular in the recent researchers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_72.wav,252844,"Now, coming to how a table is to be prepared, following are certain guidelines on it.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_73.wav,224972,"First guideline is, the title of the table. Give a suitable headline to each table, which should "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_74.wav,252556,"be short and appropriate. Second, sub headings and captions, give sub headings to different "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_75.wav,251212,"columns and rows. Captions are given to the various classifications made, like income, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_76.wav,268876,"age, etcetera. Third guideline for preparing a table is the size of the column. Each column "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_77.wav,169964,"must have the correct size, which make them look more attractive. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_79.wav,317164,"For example, alphabetically, chronologically. Next, total, columns must have different totals, each column "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_80.wav,252204,"having their own totals. Next, demarcation of columns, if columns have been divided further "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_81.wav,239724,"into subgroups, they should be in a suitable order and with sub headings, then footnotes, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_82.wav,176652,if there is anything special about the table of figures which need to be brought to attention. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_83.wav,232044,The same should be mentioned in a footnote to the table. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_84.wav,232396,"Data interpretation, after data has been processed and analyzed, interpretation of data is done. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_85.wav,202924,"Now, there is a fine line of difference between data processing and data interpretation.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_86.wav,264972,Interpretation leads to what the given research findings really mean. And what is the underlying generalization 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_87.wav,260844,which is manifested through the data which is collected. Further interpretation may be 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_88.wav,248396,"descriptive, analytical or theoretical as the researcher deems fit. Hence, under data "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_89.wav,210284,"interpretation, the conclusions that the researcher has reached after the data has been processed "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_90.wav,81964,and analyzed are further interpreted. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_91.wav,225324,"Now, there, there are certain techniques of interpretation. The following are the same. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_92.wav,255692,"First, researcher must be given reasonable explanation of the relation which he has founded "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_93.wav,204524,and the interpretation must be in the line of this relationship and the underlining process. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_94.wav,214124,They also must be uniform and coherent in interpretation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_95.wav,210956,Second technique of interpretation is that extraneous information if collected must also 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_96.wav,218252,"be considered for the final interpretation, they may have a key factor in them. Third, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_97.wav,242284,consult an expert in the field before embarking the final interpretation. The expert might 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_98.wav,218316,"give an insight into the research result, which will further help the researcher.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_99.wav,213164,"And finally, all relevant factors must be considered before finishing the final interpretation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_100.wav,209644,The researcher must not be in a haste. He might come to an inaccurate result because 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_101.wav,65612,of such a haste. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_102.wav,228876,"Now, what are the types of data analysis? Data analysis can be divided into two types, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_103.wav,268492,there is a descriptive data analysis and influential analysis. Descriptive analysis has been defined 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_104.wav,308204,by C Emory as largely the study of distribution of one variable. This study provides us with 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_105.wav,273676,"profiles of companies, work groups, persons and other subjects on any multiple characteristics, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_106.wav,179884,"such as size, composition, efficiency, preference, etcetera. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_107.wav,256364,"Now, an illustration of a descriptive analysis is that, let's say the researcher is collecting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_108.wav,231404,data from various law colleges in India to map the job preferences of students in the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_109.wav,279052,"final year of L L B . In such a research, job preferences like litigation, corporate, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_110.wav,182444,"further studies, judiciary, etcetera become the variables. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_111.wav,266316,Tools which are used under descriptive analysis are percentage and mean method. The data under 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_112.wav,248684,"descriptive analysis are then further represented in a graph. Now, coming to inferential analysis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_113.wav,245804,For testing hypotheses in order to determine with what validity data can be set to indicate 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_114.wav,147532,"some conclusion or conclusions, inferential analysis is used. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_115.wav,205164,"Now, an illustration of this can be that the researcher studying the access to justice "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_116.wav,220524,system in India. And his hypothesis being that the Indian justice delivery system favors 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_117.wav,216044,the haves and marginalizes the have-nots. The data collected is from various stages 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_118.wav,277836,"in the delivery system like police station, Courts of Justice, litigants, etcetera.   "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_119.wav,218924,"Once the data is collected, processed, then the researcher does the inferential analysis to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_120.wav,191052,test the validity of the hypothesis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_121.wav,194604,"What are the general characteristics of analysis of data? First, the researcher should keep "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_122.wav,212204,"in mind that analysis will vary depending upon the nature of the study, that is, whether "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_123.wav,229484,the study undertaken is a qualitative study or quantitative study or a mixed combination 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_124.wav,206444,of the both. Second characteristic that the researcher must keep in mind regarding analysis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_125.wav,230124,of data is that researcher should possess thorough knowledge of the area of research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_126.wav,40044,and data collected. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_127.wav,211564,"Third characteristic is that the data to be analyzed and interpreted should be reducible, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_128.wav,219276,be readily disposed to quantitative treatment and have significance for some systematic 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_129.wav,237132,theory and can serve as broad generalization. Fourth general characteristic that should 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_130.wav,211244,be kept in mind regarding analysis of data is that researcher must keep a clear set of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_131.wav,242604,"hypotheses formulated at the very start of the research, which will lead to clearer actions "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_132.wav,142156,and better data collection as well as analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_133.wav,206412,"Fifth characteristic is that in case the data collected is from vague clues, rather than "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_134.wav,244556,"according to the specific hypothesis. In such cases, the data are analyzed inductively, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_135.wav,242924,"or investigated during the process and not by means of any prescribed set of rules. Six, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_136.wav,284204,"for a successful study, the researcher must keep in mind the task of analysis and interpretation "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_137.wav,157772,should be designed before the data is actually collected. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_138.wav,300524,Data Analysis also includes statistical analysis. Statistics is an important tool for a researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_139.wav,204556,"The science of collection, presenting and analysis and interpretation of numerical data "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_140.wav,245484,"is termed to be statistics. Statistics is useful in old fields of research and study, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_141.wav,257292,including law. In a research with a large data statistics helps introducing such data 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_142.wav,200396,"into a more manageable size for the purpose of analysis, and further interpretation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_143.wav,235884,"Now, coming to an illustration, where statistics can be of use to a law researcher.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_144.wav,285164,"The researcher, let's say is doing an impact analysis of the national security, National Food Security "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_145.wav,205772,"Act of two thousand thirteen. In the National Capital Territory, the universe of the researcher "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_146.wav,217996,in such a case is Delhi and the population is all the segments of people who are eligible 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_147.wav,227564,"for the food under the said act. The tools of data collection chosen by the researcher, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_148.wav,88364,let's say is the survey method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_149.wav,227212,"Once the data is collected, the size of the data would be big. Here, the statistical tool "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_150.wav,245836,"would be of great assistance to the researcher to achieve his research objective. Now, statistics "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_151.wav,264364,"also has certain limitations, which should be kept in mind by any researcher who is employing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_152.wav,108204,statistical analysis in his research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_153.wav,313612,"Some of these limitations are, first, qualitative values like subjective perceptions, qualities "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_154.wav,297356,and attributes are not considered under statistics. It only considers quantities. This by far 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_155.wav,246732,is the greatest limitation of statistics. Second limitation is that statistics studies 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_156.wav,254156,and analyzes group attributes rather than individual characteristics and values. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_157.wav,288364,Another limitation of statistics is that statistical analysis is mostly based on average.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_158.wav,280044,"Hence, the inferences drawn through them are only approximate and not exact like that of mathematics. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_159.wav,253772,"Fourth, limitation of statistics is that it only helps discover, analyze certain characteristics. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_160.wav,266636,"It does not explain the entire picture. Hence, it only forms a part of the inference and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_161.wav,269132,statistical interpretation is part of the larger interpretation of the available data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_162.wav,221196,"Now, there are certain tools which are generally employed for statistical analysis, I would "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_163.wav,242924,"name a few. First is measure of central tendency, measuring dispersion, measure of asymmetry, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_164.wav,295692,"and finally, the fourth one, measure of relationship. These four are different types of tools that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_165.wav,294476,any person specifically a researcher employs for the analysis of the data which is statistical. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_166.wav,263724,These days statistical software packages are also available. Softwares packages are basically 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_167.wav,164524,computerized statistical data analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_168.wav,219564,"Some of the packages are the popular ones like SAS , which stands for statistical analysis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_169.wav,286092,"system and SPSS , which is statistical package for social sciences. Now, then what happens "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_170.wav,254796,to a data analysis when there is hypotheses in the research. When specific hypothesis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_171.wav,230444,"has been set down, then the major part of analysis involves getting the appropriate "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_172.wav,228844,"combination of data and reading them, so as to verify or falsify the hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_173.wav,245516,"A hypothesis, which is tested for possible rejection is known as null hypothesis.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_174.wav,201612,The null hypothesis is very useful in testing the significant difference between what was 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_175.wav,225324,"assumed and observed value. Now, there are certain precautions which every researcher "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_176.wav,177932,should keep in mind while analyzing and interpreting a data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_177.wav,208716,First precaution is that comprehensive knowledge and proper perspective must be there.   
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_178.wav,207724,The researcher while analyzing the data must have thorough knowledge of the research from a 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_179.wav,292204,"wider perspective, rather than analyzing the immediate element of the problem. Second precaution "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_180.wav,198764,that can be taken by the researcher for analysis and interpretation of the data is that he 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_181.wav,276844,should take into account all pertinent elements. All relevant factors must be considered while 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_182.wav,238764,"analyzing. Failure to do so, will make the generalizations drawn inaccurate. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_183.wav,208364,Another precaution that the researcher must keep in mind is the limitation of the study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_184.wav,209292,"The researcher must always mention all the limitations in the study, like let's say non "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_185.wav,259884,"representation in sampling, bias in the data, inadequacy in the design, inaccurate statistical "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_186.wav,89996,analysis to name a few. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_187.wav,192044,Another precaution that the researcher must always bear in mind before analyzing an interpretation 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_188.wav,279724,"is proper evaluation of data, suitable interpretation of data lies on proper evaluation of facts. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_189.wav,187244,The researcher must interpret and analyze the data thoroughly himself for better use. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_191.wav,176684,"and the primary one and the most attractive one is the diagrammatic representation, which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_192.wav,195564,is user diagrams in representing the data which has been analyzed. There are various 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_193.wav,233964,"types of data representations like graph, bar diagram, pie chart, histograms, pictograph. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_194.wav,244812,We will look at these in the subsequent slides. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_195.wav,266956,"In a graph, there are two axises, the X and the Y, X axis is horizontal and the Y axis "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_196.wav,227564,is vertical intersecting the X axis. The point where intersection occurs is the place of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_197.wav,271724,origin. The independent variable are scaled on the X axis and the dependent ones on the Y axis.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_198.wav,218572,In the above example of the graph the growth of female literacy in India since 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_199.wav,251564,"independence has been shown. The X axis has the years, while the Y axis has the rate of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_200.wav,106956,growth of women literacy in India. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_201.wav,198124,Next example of a diagrammatic representation is a bar diagram. The bar diagrams are drawn 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_202.wav,226284,"either vertically or horizontally, each bar indicating the value of the variable.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_203.wav,260492,"In the illustration, the bar diagram indicates by way example, what was the voters turnout till "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_204.wav,208364,the year two thousand ten general election in the state of Delhi. The data is merely 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_205.wav,187884,for illustrative purposes. Another type of data representation through diagram is a pie chart.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_206.wav,294796,"In a pie chart, the data is presented in the form of a circle with each category "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_207.wav,193932,occupying a segment that is proportional according to the size of its data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_208.wav,211884,"In the illustration, the percentage distribution of the various types of crimes in India in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_209.wav,215724,the year two thousand has been highlighted. Another diagrammatic representation example 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_210.wav,238476,"is a pictograph. Under a pictograph, each picture represents a certain number, and the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_211.wav,224364,total number of pictures give the total number of events or elements. Following is an example 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_212.wav,200332,"of it, where population of Middlebury from the year nineteen forty one to two thousand "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_213.wav,245164,"one has been represented. In it each figure represents thousand persons. So, one can calculate "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_214.wav,129036,the total amount by counting them. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_215.wav,228844,"Another example of data representation through diagram is a histogram. In histogram, the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_216.wav,232364,values of variables are represented in vertical bars drawn adjacent to each other. The difference 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_217.wav,238764,"between a graph and a histogram is that while in a graph points are plotted, and then joined "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_218.wav,211212,"with each other. In a histogram, only bars are drawn. A histogram can be transformed "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_219.wav,210924,into a line graph by joining the middle points of the tops of the blocks with straight lines. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_220.wav,205484,Following is an example of a histogram representing the final scores of the students. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_221.wav,247084,"Hence, in this presentation, we saw that data analysis is an important step of the entire "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_222.wav,262156,"research process. Through data analysis, a researcher learns systematic and scientific "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_223.wav,145612,researching skill and how the researching that has been done by him can be put to accurate findings.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_224.wav,275916,"Through data analysis, the command over various tools and techniques is learned. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_13_Data_Analysis_225.wav,183724,And then a more fulfilling and fruitful result of the entire research outcome is possible.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_5.wav,264076,the various types of legal reasoning methods in terms of kinds of arguments. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_6.wav,176364,Legal reasoning as a concept is a process of thinking which helps a researcher to come 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_7.wav,206732,to decision relating to law. Law is a tool of social control that attempts to resolve 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_8.wav,174796,"conflicts in the society, to direct current activity while maintaining continuity with "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_9.wav,245804,"the past, and to control the future by laying down procedures, approaches and theories. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_10.wav,191052,Every decision must be guided and followed by a logical reasoning which takes into account 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_11.wav,208044,"the past decisions and statutes, the present position of the parties to the cases and its "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_12.wav,240716,own impact on future activity. There are four basic components in legal reasoning 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_14.wav,216332,to the internal consistency and equal application of the law. It refers to more than formal 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_15.wav,265996,logic; formal logic is the science of deriving a conclusion from stated premises. It is not 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_16.wav,216652,directly concerned with either true or false. A person can obtain a false but logically 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_17.wav,212236,"correct conclusion from a false premise. Therefore, logic prefers to make correct application "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_18.wav,264332,of precedents and equal application of law. Justice is to do right between the parties. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_19.wav,185676,Experience is an important component in legal reasoning. The life of the law has not been 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_20.wav,254412,"logic, it has been experience. Experience gives power to give good legal judgements. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_21.wav,197484,The last component is the policy. The term policy may be used to describe the process 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_22.wav,205516,of approaching a problem. Policy is used to mean a scientific attempt to peer into the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_23.wav,247404,future and foresee the consequences of a decision. The use of this approach requires the individual 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_24.wav,195532,to put aside the current interest of the parties and to keep in mind how this decision would 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_25.wav,141196,"affect other persons in future. Now, we will discuss the types of logical "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_26.wav,264652,"reasoning and their principles. Among the above four components that is logic, justice, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_27.wav,203276,"experience and policy, logical thinking is the core concept of legal reasoning as scientific "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_28.wav,252812,generalizations are based on logical explanations. Every science is based on the principles of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_29.wav,276524,logic or reason. Science involves the rule of reasoning or use of arguments. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_30.wav,281004,"Arguments are made on the basis of connection, relationship, association, property, common variable, or "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_31.wav,176364,attribute between things and activities mentioned in the argument. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_32.wav,268556,"Arguments can be categorized as deductive, inductive, inverse deductive, analogy and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_33.wav,271084,"a fortiori. Dealing them one at a time, first, we will discuss the deductive method.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_34.wav,166764,The method of studying a phenomenon by taking some assumptions and deducting conclusions 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_35.wav,224044,from these assumptions is known as the deductive method. Deduction is a process of reasoning 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_36.wav,196844,"from the general to particular or from the universe to individual, from give premises "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_37.wav,233964,"to necessary conclusions. Deduction is also known as analytical, abstract, and a priori "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_38.wav,169644,method. It has an abstract approach to the study of science. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_39.wav,196204,Deductive method is a part of the scientific method. It is basically a rational approach 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_40.wav,193644,in accordance with the tenets of deductive logic. Deductive logic uses a general statement 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_41.wav,218284,"as the basis of argument. Core of the common forms of deductive logic is syllogism, which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_42.wav,269164,"runs like this. Plants grow in day time, a cactus is a plant, therefore cactus plant "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_43.wav,195564,grow in day time. The third statement follows from the first and second statements taken 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_44.wav,135724,"together. A syllogism consists of a major premise, a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_45.wav,298604,minor premise and a conclusion. A major premise usually states a general rule. In legal arguments 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_46.wav,203244,this is generally a statement of law. A minor premise makes a factual assertion about a 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_47.wav,239724,"particular person or thing or a group of persons of things. In legal arguments, this is usually "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_48.wav,227564,a statement of fact. A conclusion connects the particular statement in the minor premise 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_49.wav,174764,"with the general one in the major premise, and tells us how the general rule applies "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_50.wav,194604,"to the facts at hand. In legal arguments, this process is called "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_51.wav,226284,"applying the law to the facts. Taken for example, to qualify as a victim of rape under criminal "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_52.wav,220844,"law there must be sexual intercourse with a women, the intercourse must be without her "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_53.wav,239084,"will, this is the major premise which states a rule of law. Here, the women had consensual "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_54.wav,219564,"sex, this is the minor premise which makes a statement of fact. Therefore, the plaintiff "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_55.wav,171564,cannot be a victim of rape under criminal law. This is the conclusion which correctly 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_56.wav,186604,"applies the law to the facts. In order for a syllogism to be valid, it must "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_57.wav,199724,be logically impossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion to be false.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_58.wav,217964,"In other words, a syllogism is valid if given the truth of a premises the conclusion follows "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_59.wav,247084,"logically, such that it too must be true. An argument is not valid simply because its "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_60.wav,247724,"premises and conclusion are all true. Take this as an example, all teachers are human, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_61.wav,182444,"some humans are excellent racers, therefore, some teachers are excellent racers. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_62.wav,230764,"If read apart, each of these statements is true. Teachers are indeed human, some human, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_63.wav,206124,"for example, athletes are excellent racers and as it happens, some teachers are also "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_64.wav,248364,"good racers, but this argument is not valid. The fact that teachers are humans and that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_65.wav,165804,"some humans are excellent racers, does not prove anything about the racing ability of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_66.wav,241644,"teachers. Based on the information we are given in the premises, it is logically possible "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_67.wav,174444,that no teacher of the world has ever stepped foot in field for running. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_68.wav,185612,"Because it is logically possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_69.wav,189516,this argument is not logically valid. The example given above is a fallacious argument. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_70.wav,177644,When researchers propose a study of the casual factors of the delinquencies which are on 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_71.wav,173164,"the increase and which seems injurious to them, they have some general anticipatory "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_72.wav,209324,"idea as to what to be observed, and what specific facts in the main would be relevant to the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_73.wav,192652,"enquiry, even though they may not have realized these implications. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_74.wav,204876,Then on the basis of their observation they formulate certain single propositions as to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_75.wav,188204,"the casual factors of delinquencies. That is, they deduced from the complexities of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_76.wav,213804,"observed behavior certain single idea. In other words, they use a process of reasoning "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_77.wav,215084,about the whole observed situations in order to arrive at a particular idea. This process 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_78.wav,212204,"of reasoning is called deduction or deductive reasoning. The following example, can be sited "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_79.wav,165164,"for the deductive reasoning. Cesare Lombroso, an Italian criminologist "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_80.wav,215084,"and founder of the Italian school of Positivist Criminology, observed peculiar physical features "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_81.wav,193324,among the criminals and by using the logical deductive thinking formulated the following 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_82.wav,239724,propositions by taking his observations into consideration. Criminals are by birth a distinct 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_83.wav,290604,"type of persons. They can be recognized by stigma or anomalies such as asymmetrical cranium, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_84.wav,250284,"long lower jaw, flattened nose, scanty beard and low sensitivity to pains. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_85.wav,226924,These physical anomalies identify the personally which is predisposed criminal behavior and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_86.wav,234924,"lastly, such person cannot refrain from committing crime unless the circumstances of life are "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_87.wav,234604,"generally favored. Deduction is logical reasoning, and if we start with good premises deduction "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_88.wav,206764,can serve scientific research in three ways. Number one deduction helps in detecting the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_89.wav,193036,questionable assumptions logically involved in what is believed to be the truth and it 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_90.wav,195532,implies the number of available hypothesis for formulating the possible alternatives. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_91.wav,227884,"Secondly, the logical deduction of its consequences make clear the meaning of any hypothesis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_92.wav,233644,"Thirdly, the process of rigorous deduction is an aid in the attempt to steer clear of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_93.wav,225324,irrelevancies and thus the right principle is found. There are certain steps to be followed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_95.wav,228524,to a any investigation is the existence of a definite problem in the mind of the researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_96.wav,170924,The problem must be one of significance for the actual world. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_97.wav,240364,Step two is about setting up the hypothesis from assumptions. Here the researcher has 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_98.wav,210284,to select the assumptions from which the conclusion will be derived. The assumption must be derived 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_99.wav,272364,from observation; they must be close to reality. On the basis of suitable assumptions hypothesis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_100.wav,241644,"may be formulated. A hypothesis is a conjecture, a hunch of the possible connection between "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_101.wav,305324,two phenomena. Step three is about theoretical development of the hypothesis; the nature 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_102.wav,235884,and implication of hypothesis have to be carefully analyzed to formulate a theory. This is purely 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_103.wav,281964,"the deductive part of the process; by logical reasoning, we have to deduce the consequences. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_104.wav,235244,"Deductive explanation consist of two parts, the explanandum and explanans. The explanandum "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_105.wav,269132,"is the event, problem or thing to be explained, and is the conclusion of a deductive argument. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_106.wav,224396,It may be an individual event. The explanans is the premise and explain the explanandum 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_107.wav,242284,that is the conclusion. The explanandum is deduced from the explanans. The deductive 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_108.wav,225964,explanation has a valid argument because it takes the form of conditional argument affirming 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_109.wav,290284,"the antecedent, which is a valid form of inference. Step four is about verification of the theories. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_110.wav,223724,"Now, we shall discuss the merits and demerits of deductive method. The merits of deductive "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_111.wav,220524,method are that it is very powerful because it makes use of a valid form of deductive 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_112.wav,311724,"argument where the explanandum must be true if the explanans are true. Further, this method "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_113.wav,227884,is a very simple method. From a ve… few basic facts of human nature a number of inferences 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_115.wav,191404,possible for the investigator to conduct controlled experiments with the legal phenomena in a laboratory. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_116.wav,146604,He can therefore fall back upon deductive 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_118.wav,216684,method tends for the generalisations which are accurate and exact. The demerits of deductive 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_119.wav,189452,reasoning is that it requires high degree of logic and reasoning. Not everyone can use 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_120.wav,184716,deductive methods successfully and even many experienced researcher have been trapped by 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_121.wav,231724,faulty reasoning. Another demerit is that if the researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_122.wav,225004,confines only to abstraction his model may have the elegance and be logically beautiful 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_123.wav,212204,but it may be far away from real life; thus there is a danger of building inapplicable models. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_125.wav,281996,"The assumptions must be valid if the theories are to hold good. Lastly, deductive method "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_126.wav,202572,can be application to the limited studies only. The second method of logical reasoning 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_127.wav,138284,is the inductive method. Induction is the most often used method of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_128.wav,200364,scientific research. Induction is a process of reasoning from particular cases to whole 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_129.wav,260844,group of cases from specific instances to general rules. The inductive method is also 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_130.wav,310764,"known as historical, or expirical or a posteriori method. It may be described as practical approach "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_131.wav,235596,to the research problems. It tries to remove the gulf between theory and practice. This 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_132.wav,242572,"method examines various causes, one after another, and tries to establish casual relations "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_133.wav,168044,between them. General principles are laid down after examining 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_134.wav,181164,a large number of special instances or facts. The method is said to be empirical because 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_135.wav,166124,the formulation of principle is made only after an extensive compilation of the raw 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_136.wav,274924,data of experience. The data maybe historical or statistical data. The historical instances 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_137.wav,207084,are qualitative while the statistical data are quantitative. Generalizations are made 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_138.wav,184364,after the analysis of data. Inductive reasoning starts from observable 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_139.wav,278764,"facts from which a generalization is inferred. Let us take an example. Man A died, man B "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_141.wav,211244,on the basis of these observed facts one may infer that all human beings are mortal based 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_142.wav,197772,"on inductive reasoning. To give an example for inductive reasoning, we can cite the work "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_143.wav,167724,of Doctor Goring. He conducted a research on Lombrosian concept 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_144.wav,244556,that the criminals constitute a distinct physical type. He made comparison of several thousand 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_145.wav,189484,criminals and non-criminals and finds in his investigation that there is no relation between 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_146.wav,202636,the criminal behavior and physical anomalies which are proposed by Lombroso. Induction 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_147.wav,203532,operates on faith that in the basic course of things if for a long time regularity is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_148.wav,178924,"evidenced, then it is a surety enough for the inference that it will continue in the future. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_149.wav,111084,If the premise and conclusion in the logical 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_150.wav,226604,"case are both know, some probability relations may be established between them and this may "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_151.wav,218284,serve as a paradigm of an inductive inference. Inductive explanations also have explanandum 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_152.wav,285804,and explanans. The explanandum is generally probable; explanandum cannot be deducted from 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_153.wav,217324,the explanans with certainty. The explanandum is implied by the explanans. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_154.wav,224044,The explanans support or provide evidence for the explanandum but does not make the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_155.wav,161004,latter certain. The explanans can be true and the explanandum can be still be false 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_156.wav,196204,in the inductive explanation. Inductive explanations explain either the probability of individual 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_157.wav,192364,events of stas… statistical generalization. Inductive process examines the particular 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_158.wav,205772,phenomena and discovers from them the general law. There are two laws which bind the process 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_159.wav,190476,of induction. That is the law of universal causation and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_160.wav,239724,the law of uniformity of nature. Perfect induction is a method of arriving at a universal proposition 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_161.wav,210604,and after taking into consideration all the individual instances of phenomena under investigation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_162.wav,200044,Inductive argument derives a generalized conclusion on the basis of particulars which are often 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_163.wav,213484,empirically derived observations. The premise of an inductive argument makes the conclusion 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_164.wav,169004,probable not certain. The inductive approach relies on the scientific 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_165.wav,216684,"discovery of facts. One characteristic of inductive argument is that, it establishes "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_166.wav,232044,a conclusion with the content which goes beyond its premise; from the observation of a sample 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_167.wav,215404,an inference is made about a whole population. This is called the inductive leap.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_168.wav,221484,Jumping from the premise which relates to an observed sample to the conclusion which concerns itself 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_169.wav,214764,with entire population; the greater the number or presentative units in the premise or observed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_170.wav,105004,"in the sample, the smaller is the inductive leap. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_171.wav,232684,The premise of an inductive argument does not establish the conclusion conclusively. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_172.wav,196556,The premise of a valid argument may be true but the conclusion may still be false. Its 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_173.wav,184332,Its premise only supports the conclusion but it does not make the latter certain. There are 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_174.wav,177004,also certain merits and demerits of inductive method. The merits of inductive method are 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_175.wav,197484,that it is more realistic because it studies the changes in conditions surrounding the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_176.wav,237164,social activities of man and their effect on social activities are analyzed and displayed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_177.wav,206124,Also there is a possibility of verification. The method is more useful because its propositions 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_178.wav,264652,can be tested and verified easily. This method takes full note of the complex relationship 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_179.wav,281996,found in actual life and examines them carefully. Another merit of inductive reasoning is that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_180.wav,229484,it is dynamic. This method takes into consideration the changeable nature of assumptions in its 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_181.wav,219884,analysis. It does not consider facts to be stable; therefore it is a dynamic method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_182.wav,228204,"The demerits are, it is a very difficult method. This method cannot be used by a beginner or "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_183.wav,171276,"a common man because it is impossible for an ordinary person to collect facts, study "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_184.wav,265580,them and derive some conclusion out of them. The cost is too much for him. The propositions 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_185.wav,225676,obtained through this method are based upon data collected by investigators; therefore 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_186.wav,224684,there is a danger of investigator’s bias entering into propositions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_187.wav,169324,"There is very limited scope of verification. Since, the propositions obtained through this "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_188.wav,200364,method are based on a few facts; the universal applicability of the proportions is always 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_189.wav,274284,in doubt. This method is commonly used for lifeless objects of the physical science. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_190.wav,230092,"In socio-legal studies, we study a man’s problems as such the method has a very limited use. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_191.wav,197196,If anyone ask which method is preferred the answer is both. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_192.wav,213804,"Professor Marshal says, “Induction and deduction are both needed for scientific study as right "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_193.wav,251564,"and left foot for walking.” Larrabee remarks, “If extreme rationalist that is reductionist "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_194.wav,228524,"is like a spider spinning out theories from within the extreme, expiricist, that is inductionist, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_195.wav,270764,is to be compared to an ant which piles useless heaps of facts. Better than either the spider 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_196.wav,251884,"or an ant is the bee, which selectively gathers pollen and transforms it into honey. To be "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_197.wav,188844,a bee one has to mingle both induction and deduction in intricate way.” 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_198.wav,182764,The third method of logical reasoning is the inverse deductive method. J. S. Mill is the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_199.wav,218284,chief advocate of the inverse deductive method. It is a combination of inductive generalizations 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_200.wav,219244,obtained by means of the comparative method or by statistical method with deduction from 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_201.wav,227564,"more ultimate laws. It is a way to arrive at reality through experiment, observation "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_202.wav,222124,and conclusion. This method starts with the use of deduction and then uses the method 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_203.wav,153644,of induction to find out the reason of the phenomena which is under study. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_204.wav,190092,The fourth argument is in the form of analogy. Analogy is a process of reasoning between 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_205.wav,250316,"parallel cases. In this method, conclusions are arrived at by reasoning of resemblance "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_206.wav,190444,where from partial resemblance or agreement of two things or issues to each other. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_207.wav,195532,"J.S. Mill says that, “Two things resemble each other in one or more respects; a certain "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_208.wav,135116,"proposition it true of the one, therefore it is true of the other. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_209.wav,217644,Case law involves reasoning by analogy. In practice the judiciary proceeds on the basis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_210.wav,205164,of a number of options of resemblance of relations or attributes between cases by applying the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_211.wav,228876,old rule to the new case. A fortiori is other method of reasoning. This 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_212.wav,186572,phrase is used in logic to denote an argument to the effect that because one ascertained 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_213.wav,252844,"fact exist, therefore another which is included in it or analogous to it and is less improbable, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_214.wav,266924,unusual or surprising must also exists. A fortiori in Latin means with even stronger 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_215.wav,227532,"reasons and applies to a situation in which if one thing is true, then it can be inferred "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_216.wav,220236,"that a second thing is even more certainly true. For example, if something is prohibited "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_217.wav,215084,"then it is assumed that anything more obvious is prohibited. Now, let us recapitulate what "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_218.wav,220812,"we have learnt so far in this module. In logic there are two distinct methods of reasoning, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_219.wav,186316,namely the deductive and inductive approach. Deductive reasoning works from the general 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_220.wav,276844,"to the specific, this is also called a top-down approach. The deductive reasoning works as "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_221.wav,255404,"follows. Think of a theory about topic and then narrow it down to specific hypothesis, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_222.wav,242604,hypothesis that we can test or can be tested. Narrow down further if we would like to collect 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_223.wav,243916,"observations from hypothesis. In a conclusion when we will use deduction, we reason from "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_224.wav,218540,general principles two specific cases as in applying a mathematical theorem to a particular 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_225.wav,163916,problem or inciting a law of physics to predict the outcome of an experiment. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_226.wav,226284,An inductive reasoning works the other way around. It works from observation or observations 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_227.wav,265324,towards generalization and theories. This is also called a bottom-up approach.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_228.wav,221132,"Inductive reason start from a specific observations, look for patterns or no patterns, regularities "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_229.wav,252204,"or irregularities, formulate hypothesis that one could work with and finally ended up developing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_230.wav,260236,"general theories or drawing conclusion. In a conclusion when one use induction, he "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_231.wav,177644,observes a number of specific instances and from them infer a general principle of law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_232.wav,206764,"These two methods are very different in nature when used in conducting researches, other "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_233.wav,269484,"than being top-down and bottom-up. Inductive reasoning is open ended and exploratory, especially "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_234.wav,193324,"at the beginning. On the other hand, deductive reasoning is narrow in nature and is concerned "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_235.wav,264652,"with testing or confirming hypothesis. Comparing the two reasoning, we first recollect the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_236.wav,199116,properties of deduction. In a valid deductive argument all of the content 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_237.wav,261804,"of the conclusion is present, at least implicitly in the premises. If the premises are true "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_238.wav,247084,"the conclusion must be true, valid deduction is necessarily truth preserving. If new premises "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_239.wav,206764,"are added to a valid deductive argument, the argument remains valid. Deduction is erosion "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_240.wav,236204,proof; deductive validity is an all or nothing matter. The conclusion of an inductive argument 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_241.wav,153324,has content that goes beyond the content of its premises. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_242.wav,247404,A correct inductive argument may have true premises and a false conclusion.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_243.wav,218924,Induction is not necessarily truth preserving. New premises may completely undermine a strong inductive argument.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_244.wav,218604,Induction is not erosion proof. Inductive arguments come in different degrees 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_245.wav,200684,of strength. In some inductions the premises support the conclusions more strongly than 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_246.wav,216044,"in others, but some philosophers have doubt that induction is really a method of logical "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_247.wav,193644,"reasoning, since observations of past instances may never be sufficient to give a certainty "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_248.wav,253804,"about what will happen in future. For example, observing billions of billions of white swans "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_249.wav,129004,does not imply that all swans are white. Thank you!

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_18.wav,192684,Research has its theoretical and methodological base in the social sciences. It seeks to understand

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_20.wav,240044,research such as the black letter tradition. Its methodology is predominantly empirical 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_21.wav,244844,and social-theoretical rather than doctrinal. Law is not merely a black letter rather it 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_22.wav,191084,is an instrument of social control. It originates and functions in a society and

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_63.wav,257964,occupy space between two extremes of methodological spectrum. At one end a strict doctrinal approach 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_64.wav,182732,relies predominantly on self-informed analysis of legislation and judicial decisions from 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_65.wav,142764,the superior courts. Approaches at the other end such as critical

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_82.wav,154604,the interrelationship between law and the other aspects of society. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_83.wav,207116,"One issue is how, one issue is how law as a system of social rule interacts with other "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_84.wav,250284,"system of social rules such as those of civil associations, religious bodies, private institutions, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_85.wav,245804,family networks and so on. What happens when legal rules conflict with or try to change 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_86.wav,189164,other networks of rules? Here the notion of social sphere is developed and put to use 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_87.wav,219532,in explaining the interrelationship. In developing this analysis law needs to be broken down 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_88.wav,212236,"into different kinds of laws such as criminal, civil, constitutional and regulation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_89.wav,202604,"The last issue is about the effectiveness of law, if a state law is explained and justified "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_90.wav,184044,on the basis that it has certain social advantage over systems of social rules then the assumption 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_91.wav,219884,"is that law is effective in influencing behavior. Here notions of implementation, compliance "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_92.wav,239052,"and enforcement come into picture. Now, what is the political science approach? The first "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_93.wav,249996,approach is about legal mobilization. There exist a complex relationship between law and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_94.wav,150092,social movements. Social movement actors use a wide range of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_95.wav,260204,"legal tactics including lobbying, litigation and administrative advocacy in their campaign "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_96.wav,246796,"for social, political and economic change. On one hand movements rely on rights to frame "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_97.wav,220204,"their grievances, to define and reinforce collective identity and to mobilize activist. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_98.wav,167052,The realm of the law can provide social reforms campaigns with opportunities to influence 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_99.wav,248044,policy regulation and enforcement practices. On the other hand the use of legal strategies 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_100.wav,217964,"and reliance on lawyers can exert a conservative pressure on social movements, channeling protest "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_101.wav,266284,and other forms of radical action into conventional political and legal institutions. These tensions 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_102.wav,183756,inherent in legal mobilization activity have raised a number of theoretical and empirical 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_103.wav,188172,questions. What are the conditions under which individual and collective actors will turn 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_104.wav,222444,to the courts to pursue political or social goals? What is the best way for researchers 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_105.wav,182156,"interested in social movements to determine social movement success within the courts, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_106.wav,173452,within the policy realm and beyond? What is the impact of legal mobilization on 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_107.wav,196524,a social movement’s collective identity? The literature on the mobilization of law 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_108.wav,218284,a social movements by providing a bottom of perspective draws on compliments and provides 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_109.wav,301196,alternatives to courts center studies of social reform. The second approach concentrates on 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_110.wav,241324,"judicial review and human rights, political science approaches to the study of law particularly "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_111.wav,157164,explores how political science can be applied to study the role of courts in protecting 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_112.wav,190764,human rights. The third approach concerns itself with the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_113.wav,201612,"role of courts in democracy, the judiciary is a high-impact institution. When functioning "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_115.wav,232396,the individual from arbitrary state power. In countries transitioning from authoritarian 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_116.wav,232364,rule to democracy a judiciary empower to vindicate the constitution is by consensus regarded 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_117.wav,200972,as essential to democratic consolidation. Given the important role courts are believed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_118.wav,221196,"to play, it is not surprising that sociologists and political scientists have in recent decades "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_119.wav,235564,"paid ever more attention to judicial affairs. One post world war second trend identified, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_120.wav,178924,documented and analyzed by a diverse sub-group of these investigators stands out for its 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_121.wav,305324,ubiquity namely the worldwide expansion of both domestic and supranational judicial power.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_123.wav,177036,"and its horrors, many have come to see the judiciary as a check on the alleged evils "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_124.wav,223724,of untrammeled democracy. In one jurisdiction after another even in the most conservative 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_125.wav,186892,and authoritarian civil law traditions courts have been empowered or have empowered themselves

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_127.wav,188556,to be unconstitutional. The judicial assumption of power not merely 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_128.wav,198764,to nullify democratically enacted legislation but also to legislate new general norms in

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_131.wav,186316,standing controversies can be seen in this like what ought to be the role of courts in 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_132.wav,213772,a democratic society? Ought judges to intervene in policy processes or should they confine 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_133.wav,177036,themselves to deciding the guilt or innocence of individual persons.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_138.wav,232364,to the socio-legal research. The first approach places law in the socio-legal and socio-cultural context. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_139.wav,141132,This explores the way in which the framework 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_140.wav,231116,of cultural relativism can assist the exploration of law and a social construct. The factors 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_141.wav,196492,"affecting that process includes historically formed traditions, existing institutional "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_142.wav,266316,settings and contemporary changes. Legal cultures affect the development process in transitional 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_143.wav,223404,societies. As far as methodological issues are concerned there are relative merits of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_144.wav,227884,using qualitative and quantitative methods together research data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_145.wav,240044,"The second approach ask a question, can law control? The law acts as a would-be instrument "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_146.wav,204812,"of control, demonstrating the social and legal factors that influence its implementation "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_147.wav,234316,"and enforcement, and addressing the problematic notion of compliance and the areas of business "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_148.wav,240364,regulation. There can also be alternative perspective as well and researcher shall focus 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_149.wav,226284,on thinking outside the box in order to inform conventional wisdom and to formulate perspective

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_151.wav,242924,which means generally the law beyond government. How shall we understand the different types 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_152.wav,196844,and systems of law that occur throughout the world? By considering radically different 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_153.wav,242604,"examples of law beyond government, what conclusions can we draw about the nature of law itself? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_154.wav,174124,There are examples of the approaches that anthropologists have taken to law in other 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_155.wav,216044,"societies and cultures, including informal systems of law and dispute resolution. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_156.wav,208332,There exist examples of cultural specificity of legal concepts and models. The research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_157.wav,190476,methods typically used by anthropologists are participant observation involving long

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_171.wav,181516,such as the following. What are we trying to achieve when we are engaged in research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_172.wav,165164,activities? Do qualitative and quantitative approaches have equal claims to be considered 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_173.wav,207404,empirical? When we decide on which methods to use in collecting the information we need 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_174.wav,177356,what assumptions are we making and what do they imply? What philosophical approaches

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_183.wav,236204,The use of quantitative methods in socio-legal scholarship is ever growing. There is a growing 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_184.wav,222444,trend towards empirical legal studies where empirical is defined as large N or quantitative methods.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_186.wav,163564,is a type of research that could be regarded as diametrically opposed to the collection 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_187.wav,211884,of quantitative data. This relates not only to the methods but to the types of questions 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_188.wav,150124,that can be answered. The research design and the subsequent analysis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_189.wav,208044,of data - The researcher shall keep in mind the nature of ethnography and participant

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_191.wav,227212,quantitative and ethnographic methodologies. A case study regarding about participant observation 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_192.wav,187884,would help and places the researcher in a position to anticipate whether he or she might

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_213.wav,307564,spectrum. At one end a strict doctrinal approach relies predominantly on self-informed analysis 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_214.wav,240684,of legislation and judicial decisions from the superior courts. Approaches at the other 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_215.wav,269164,"end such as critical legal studies and economic analysis of law are tuned to the concerns, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_216.wav,248044,theory and informants of external perspectives. While contextual analysis is increasingly 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_217.wav,267884,"the norm in legal scholarship, external informants are essential to a socio-legal approach.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_218.wav,248684,The socio-legal lens widens to observe operational and every daily legal situations and diverse 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_219.wav,216972,"textual sources, disciplinary and culture perspectives are considered. Thank you. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_0.wav,175404,Hi. I am Manvi Tiku. You are watching a module on Research Ethics for Research Methodology 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_1.wav,86124,in the course Law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_2.wav,207404,"So, what is Research Ethics really? Well, to begin with let us understand what do you "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_3.wav,217932,mean by a research. A researcher actually speaking lives in every human being.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_4.wav,188908,The thing that differentiates a researcher from another human being is the fact that a researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_5.wav,182092,is able to see some or the other problem in the societal dynamics that he is surrounded 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_6.wav,117484,"with, problem as in a research problem. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_7.wav,200652,Well societal dynamics always give rise to some or the other social problem because of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_8.wav,275276,conflict of interest which we as law students are all aware of. These societal problems 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_9.wav,222124,"are looked at or observed by different researchers or by different people in different ways, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_10.wav,203884,and this kind of observation or the different observations give rise to different set of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_11.wav,101804,research problems in the minds of different researchers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_12.wav,284204,"Let us take for example, the problem of increasing number of rapes in India may give rise to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_13.wav,190412,an idea in a researcher’s mind that some research is due in the punitive section of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_14.wav,231116,"our criminal law, so he wants to study punishment and to another researcher the same problem "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_15.wav,232684,of rapes may give rise to an idea that some research is due in the patriarchal side of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_16.wav,184364,"the feminist studies, so he wants to study feminolo… feminist studies and he wants "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_17.wav,72044,to study patriarchy in that. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_18.wav,168684,"Now, what does this tell us? This tells us that the social problems maybe same, they "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_19.wav,174444,"may be common because they are coming out from the societal dynamics, but the way that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_20.wav,173804,these social problems are observed and the way that these social problems are perceived 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_21.wav,216684,"by different people gives rise to different ideas, different set of ideas in different people.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_22.wav,157164,What does this tell us? This tells us that it is not just a social problem that is important 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_23.wav,193004,"for research, but also the innovation and imagination of of every person comes into "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_24.wav,200044,"play when we are talking about legal research. So, a research problem is formulated in a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_25.wav,207084,researcher’s mind. He takes up a research. He is able to get some sponsorship for his 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_26.wav,123244,research and what does that heal for him that is a research report. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_27.wav,177324,"So, the research that he conducts or the research idea that was actually conceived by him in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_28.wav,160684,the first place are all tangible things that cannot be seen or touched but the research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_29.wav,185004,"report is something that he is able to produce and we can see it, we can read it and therefore, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_30.wav,252204,we can understand what in what way did that particular researcher perceive a particular social problem. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_31.wav,252844,"Now, why do we need research ethics? Well ethics and morality are some things which "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_32.wav,224364,govern each and every aspect of our life. We do not walk out of the doors of our house 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_33.wav,199084,"without ethics, well even within the four walls of our house we always follow ethics and morality.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_34.wav,251884,These are the basic rules that one has to follow being a human being because 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_35.wav,154604,"we are not animals, we are higher intellectual animals. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_36.wav,197132,"Now, why do we need ethics in research? Research is something that is to be conducted by every "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_37.wav,167116,"individual differently. He has his own set of notions, he has his own set of ideals. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_38.wav,172844,"So, why do we need ethics really? Well that is the catch. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_39.wav,153644,The problem is that even though a research problem may be formulated by different people 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_40.wav,195564,"due to their own imagination and due to their innovation, yet the end result that is the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_41.wav,177964,"research report, which is the most important thing may become a common factor. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_42.wav,190124,A research report which has been produced by one person may be used by another person 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_43.wav,153644,"saying that ‘it is my research report’. So, now what that other person is doing?  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_44.wav,195532,He is trying to get away with someone else’s work saying that it is his own work. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_45.wav,220844,"That is unethical, he may add some points here and there and just produce a a very "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_46.wav,156556,laminated version of that older research and say that it is my own research. That is not 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_47.wav,225004,only wrong for the earlier research and the earlier researcher but also it puts in a bad 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_48.wav,102124,light on the whole fraternity of researchers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_49.wav,225964,"So, why do we need research ethics really? Number one – To have a common set of standards. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_50.wav,147244,"What do you mean by common set of standards? Well, the set of standards that would be followed "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_51.wav,201964,"by everyone equally, there won’t be any discrepancy, there won’t be any ambiguity "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_52.wav,267244,or vagueness. So one researcher cannot say that I am not aware or I I am not in the knowledge 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_53.wav,195884,"of what kind of research ethics are there, having a common set or a common standard of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_54.wav,134732,of ethics basically does away with this kind of ambiguity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_55.wav,233356,"The second thing is, it rules out all kinds of uncertainty. It is for the benefit and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_56.wav,190732,"knowledge of all the people who are coming ahead for research. The third thing is, it "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_57.wav,207436,"is a universal thing, research ethics becomes a universal common factor for everyone who "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_58.wav,122572,is coming ahead to do research plus they will have prior knowledge. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_59.wav,222476,"So, before a researcher embarks upon a research, any research, he knows what he is getting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_60.wav,179884,"into, because he knows he will have to do an ethical research and he will also know "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_61.wav,197452,"what does doing an ethical research mean, so there should be a common set of standards. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_63.wav,186924,in research or giving or conducting a ethical research basically makes a research socially 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_64.wav,175756,"acceptable. Now, why do we need social acceptance if the researcher is doing the research for himself? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_65.wav,230412,"Well, no, the researcher is doing the research for the society. The society is what be the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_66.wav,159724,knowledge bank for the researcher and it is a researcher’s responsibility to give back 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_67.wav,112716,to the society what he is gaining from the society. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_68.wav,200364,"So, to gain a social acceptance the researcher needs to do an ethical research.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_69.wav,194892,"Not only that, before embarking upon the resear… research he needs certain sanctions from certain "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_70.wav,153036,"organizations, etcetera, or he needs cer… cer… certain permissions from those people "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_71.wav,233004,"from whom he wants to collect his data, etcetera, for all these things and for having an acceptable "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_72.wav,203532,"research, the researcher must do an ethical research which will be acceptable to him, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_73.wav,183084,to the future researchers who want to research in the same field as well as to all the actors 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_74.wav,102476,and the participant who are a part of the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_75.wav,211532,The next important factor of having standard research ethics is that it maintains a minimal 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_76.wav,225356,"standard of good quality research. Research work in any country, in any field is a very "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_77.wav,186284,important component for the development of not only the society but also the knowledge 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_78.wav,65004,in that particular field. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_79.wav,182476,"Therefore, having research ethics or following research ethics or conducting a research in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_80.wav,246412,an ethical manner is what will ensure that minimal standards of good quality research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_81.wav,83884,are adhered to. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_82.wav,220844,"Most importantly doing an ethical research sets a good precedent. However, let us take "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_83.wav,140844,"an example of a person whose, who may not be doing an ethical research or who has produced "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_84.wav,135084,a research report with a lot of plagiarized material. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_85.wav,190444,"Well, what he is simply doing is he is setting a wrong precedent for those researchers whom "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_86.wav,214444,he might be guiding tomorrow when he becomes a guiding supervisor or else his plagiarized 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_87.wav,184972,material might be used as an inspiration by some other future genuine researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_88.wav,238476,"So, basically unethical research is a chain that cannot be stopped, it is an unending "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_89.wav,278764,"vicious circle. For it to stop it is a , it is the responsibility of the researcher himself "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_90.wav,223404,to maintain a particular standard so that he is able to set a precedent for the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_91.wav,193612,"Now, what do you mean by ethical research? Ethical research means following certain ethics "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_92.wav,180236,in research. Do we know what these ethics are? No. Is there any law that gives these 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_93.wav,218284,ethics? No. Then how do we know what these ethics are? if there are no law and there is 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_94.wav,76204,no particular standard that everyone knows. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_95.wav,266284,"Well, the fact is just like in life, research ethics also need to come from the logic of "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_96.wav,220812,"the particular researcher as well as from the, from his own genuinity. He needs, it "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_97.wav,122956,it needs to emanate from his own genuinity and honesty. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_98.wav,209292,Sincerity in work is the first and foremost thing that a person can do to follow ethics 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_99.wav,188876,"in research. Would you, would we be getting any reward for doing an ethical research? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_100.wav,185644,"Well, the answer is no, we do not get a reward for get doing any research. Would we be getting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_101.wav,185932,"punished if we do not do an ethical research? Again unfortunately the answer is no, we would "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_102.wav,34956,not be getting punished. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_103.wav,183724,"So, then question number one, how will we ensure that research ethics are followed? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_104.wav,153964,"And question number two, why should we follow research ethics? The answers to these questions "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_105.wav,268204,"are, we need to follow research ethics for the sake of saving grace of the whole research "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_106.wav,159724,fraternity. It sets a bad precedent to do an eth… an unethical research and the blot 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_107.wav,166764,of being an unethical research is something that will never leave the research report 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_108.wav,193324,"even if the researcher, the unethical researcher himself wants to make amendments later on. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_109.wav,188844,"Secondly, as far as the question of if there is no law or if there is no punishment then "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_110.wav,272044,"how can we ensure that the ethics are followed? It goes like this, in life we have many laws "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_111.wav,181484,"that are passed by the parliament, well do these laws, let us take for example, criminal "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_112.wav,108524,"laws, do these criminal laws stop crime from happening? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_113.wav,227884,"The answer is no, in the same way having research ethics or having a certain policy for research "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_114.wav,197804,ethics does not mean that research ethics will be followed. It only means that we have 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_115.wav,185292,a certain standard of to be followed when we are doing research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_116.wav,173196,"Now, what are these code of ethics and there any code of ethics that have been laid down? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_117.wav,161964,"The truth is that every research institution might have their own code of ethics, might "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_118.wav,105324,have their own policy and regulations with respect to it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_119.wav,179532,And for that matter every individual researcher also might be having his own set of ideas 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_120.wav,224076,to be followed as in in terms of doing an ethical research. But American Sociological 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_121.wav,222444,"Association, in particular, has come up with a set of code of ethics. These, what are these "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_122.wav,81292,code of ethics? Let us have a look at them. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_123.wav,146956,First and foremost is professional competence. What is professional competence? Does it only 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_124.wav,199084,"mean competence in terms of degree? Like for example, in India we talk about having a master’s "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_125.wav,188172,degree to be the minimal to conduct a research. Is it sufficient? Does a master’s degree 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_126.wav,132524,ensure that a person is intellectually capable to conduct the research? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_127.wav,200044,The answer may be ‘no’ because even though educational institutions that have research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_128.wav,170956,as part of their curriculum have mandated that a course on Research Methodology has 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_129.wav,217324,"to be there and have also mandated a man… a compulsory research work, yet the things "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_130.wav,194284,"that a person carries or thing that a person learns in the, during the education may not "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_131.wav,119724,be carried forward to his professional time as well. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_132.wav,169644,"So, in terms of this when a researcher proposes a particular research it is not only the duty "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_133.wav,199692,but also obligation of the supervisor as well as the research institutes or the sponsoring 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_134.wav,203276,institutes to ensure that the person is professionally competent to conduct the research.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_135.wav,249644,It is also desirable that the person himself understands it that what does it mean to be professionally 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_136.wav,216684,competent to conduct research and is honest about it and does the research accordingly. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_137.wav,139564,Second thing that has been laid down by the American Sociological Association is integrity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_138.wav,246444,"Now, the research that is to be conducted has to be honest. The research problems that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_139.wav,196812,have been emanated by the or that have been created by the researcher should be genuine. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_140.wav,185036,And most importantly the work that is being done or that is proposed to be done by the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_141.wav,245452,researcher should be it should be sincere. He should be sincere towards his efforts for the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_142.wav,190476,The third thing that has been laid down is the professional and scientific responsibility. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_143.wav,214764,"Now, the society as such is the thing that gave the researcher the research problem in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_144.wav,206732,the first place. The society is the one from where the researcher is going to collect his 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_145.wav,122636,data and then analyze and interpret his results. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_146.wav,273292,"So, the society is the one to whom the researcher owes a lot. In fact, it is the researcher’s "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_147.wav,191724,po… researcher’s responsibility to take care that whatever research he is conducting 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_148.wav,206444,"in whichever filed he is conducting a research, he should be able to professionally conduct "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_149.wav,157804,the research and follow the technicalities of the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_150.wav,132876,"For example, there are various tools that are available for data collection.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_151.wav,196844,There are various techniques for data analysis. There various techniques done for sampling.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_152.wav,224652,There are various techniques at every step of the research and it is the responsibility as well 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_153.wav,214124,as it is ethically desirable that the researcher follows all these technicalities in all sincerity. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_154.wav,185036,This is the responsibility that the researcher holds not only towards the society but towards 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_155.wav,79404,the research as such. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_156.wav,292524,"The next thing is respect for people’s rights, dignity and diversity. Well the researcher "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_157.wav,195212,is bound to collect certain data from the society. This collection of data from the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_158.wav,195596,"society is not the researcher’s right, it is his privilege because he is requesting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_159.wav,198732,the people or he is requesting the society to respond to certain questions and queries 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_160.wav,207084,that he might be having so that he he makes conclusions accordingly. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_161.wav,209004,"Now, in all this there might be some times when the researcher may gain access to certain "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_164.wav,227564,information may be very critical or very useful for the research report. In such cases it 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_165.wav,303756,"is ethically desirable that the researcher, is ethically desirable that the researcher "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_166.wav,166764,uses the information with the prior permission of the particular person whose confidential

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_168.wav,256364,"It is not only ethics that is there, but also social responsibility and a person might not "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_169.wav,162284,be even aware of is right to privacy but it is again the responsibility and obligation 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_170.wav,296044,of the researcher to first and foremost take prior permission from from the person concerned 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_171.wav,150764,whose confidential information he might have gained access to and then and only then use 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_172.wav,113324,that particular information in the module. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_173.wav,169644,"Next thing is social responsibility, as I have already mentioned and emphasized that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_174.wav,197132,the researcher owes a responsibility to the society not only because of his research but 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_175.wav,209996,also because the so… society is what gave him the research problem. The researcher must 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_176.wav,225324,at all times know that his research is going to pave way for further research in the same 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_177.wav,228172,"topic or in the same field and also it is going to help, to ameliorate certain problems "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_178.wav,171596,in the society. After all the researcher came up with the research problem because there 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_179.wav,126444,were certain problems in the society because of societal dynamics. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_180.wav,177932,"So, after understanding these code of ethics that have been laid down, let us understand "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_181.wav,171596,what are the various checkpoints in research. These checkpoints in research as we call them 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_182.wav,159404,are the places or are the points during the research when the researcher has to be very 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_183.wav,204844,"careful of following ethics. So, all these checkpoints have to be kept in mind all the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_184.wav,230764,time by the researcher so that he does not he does not digress from the path of ethical research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_185.wav,211564,First and foremost is the authorization to research. Authorization to research has to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_186.wav,224364,"be had from two main actors, one is the organization or the institution which is sponsoring the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_187.wav,213772,"research, second is the participants of the research. Now, the a researcher may have approached "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_188.wav,178316,"any organization or institution to conduct the research, he may also have approached "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_189.wav,85772,a particular institution for sponsoring the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_190.wav,201676,In both the cases he has to make sure that he has achieved or he has obtained the requisite 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_191.wav,186252,authorization to conduct this particular research. Even in cases where the research may be publicly 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_192.wav,230476,little explosive as in the content of the research or the content that is proposed to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_193.wav,215724,"be researched maybe little complicated or conflicting, it care has to be taken on part "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_194.wav,242604,of the institution that the research has to be given authorization and a green signal 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_195.wav,145964,and then and only then the researcher can go ahead with the researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_196.wav,165452,"Secondly, the researcher has to obtain authorization from the participants in the research.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_197.wav,171916,"Now, participants may be individuals, they may be families, they may be organizations or institutions.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_198.wav,161644,In all these cases the researcher has to make sure that he has obtained the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_199.wav,213164,requisite permission to be a part of their lives and observe them or collect data from them etcetera. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_200.wav,218604,It is especially very important in cases of participatory observation in which the researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_201.wav,165164,"is actually living with the people whom he wants to study, so he may not be asking any "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_202.wav,199724,"questions to them but he will be observing and taking down some notes, according to what he is observing. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_203.wav,167052,"So, he might be interfering with their lives and he has to make sure that he tells those "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_204.wav,182476,people and prior in gives them prior information as to how much interruption will they be having 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_205.wav,180236,"in their lives. So, all this is very important to gain authorization to research. Another "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_206.wav,173100,very important aspect of authorization is that every institution or organization to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_207.wav,177996,whom you may be approaching for research may have their own principle for conducting research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_208.wav,198764,"For example, lots of ministries in the government of India may have their own set of guidelines "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_209.wav,134732,"for every researcher who may come to them for any questions. So, you have to make sure "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_210.wav,188844,or the researcher has to make sure that he has comp… complied with all these guidelines 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_211.wav,177036,and he has to make sure that he gets the requisite pre-authorization to conduct the research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_212.wav,76204,before he starts the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_213.wav,192044,"Second thing is that he has to follow appropriate techniques and processes, well this is a very "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_214.wav,197804,technical point and it does not sound very ethical but the truth is that ethics does 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_215.wav,178284,"fall out, ethics does come out from the technical things of a research process itself.  "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_216.wav,269164,"So, if a researcher is not able to follow the techniques that he has read during his education time "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_217.wav,195564,"etcetera, he may not do it correctly or he may be doing a he may be applying a process "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_218.wav,110764,correctly but he may be applying it in a wrong place. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_219.wav,255372,"So, it is not shameful to go back to the books again and again for checking and referencing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_220.wav,133196,and seeing whether what you are doing or what you are conducting the process that you have 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_221.wav,180524,taken up is correct or not. But it is very shameful if you are doing a research or if 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_222.wav,167404,you are applying a particular process without actually knowing what you are doing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_223.wav,194892,"Next thing is confidentiality, so as we have already seen that respect of, respect for "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_224.wav,143724,confidentiality of the people from whom the researcher may be collecting data is very 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_225.wav,234956,"important and with a, it is not only an ethical duty but an obligation of the researcher towards the society. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_226.wav,135404,"So, researcher has to make sure to tell the people from whom he is collecting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_227.wav,224684,data and he has to ensure them and that he will not be using any confidential information 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_228.wav,126124,to whom to which he may gain access without their permission. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_229.wav,235884,Next is research responsibility. This research responsibility is not only towards the society 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_230.wav,191404,but the research field in itself. The researcher has to make sure that whatever research he 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_231.wav,244172,"does, he is putting it into the knowledge bank of the existing field, so his research "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_232.wav,225676,is not only going to affect the social dynamics in that particular field but also will steer 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_233.wav,145324,and affect the future research in that particular field. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_234.wav,210924,"Next is respect for people rights, dignity and diversity. Well the researcher has to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_235.wav,219564,know that whatever s… social problems he is looking at may be influenced by or may 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_236.wav,183052,"be affected by lot of people. Now, society is composed of diverse people, there are large "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_237.wav,88396,number of people having conflicting interest. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_238.wav,156524,The researcher has to make sure that during the ongoing process of research as well after 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_239.wav,207724,"he has come up with his results, he is not producing any more conflict in the existing "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_240.wav,172524,"conflict of interest. In other words, he has to make sure that he retains and maintains "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_241.wav,88364,the balance between the conflict of interests. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_242.wav,184044,He has to make sure that he respects the diversity of all the people present in the society to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_243.wav,216684,whom he has approached for the research or on whom the research has any kind of effect. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_244.wav,266604,Well the most important thing that the researcher has has to ensure is that he does not plagiaries 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_245.wav,79692,anything in the research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_246.wav,229516,What is plagiarism? Plagiarism is the act of taking up anyone else’s work and shh… 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_247.wav,212844,"presenting it or showing it as as your own. Well as serious as that sounds, it is a fact "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_248.wav,210924,that plagiarism is one of the most common problem that is plaguing the research world today. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_249.wav,157164,"What are the causes of plagiarism? First and foremost, it is easy. It is very easy to pick "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_250.wav,164812,up another person’s work and show it as your own. You do not have to make any efforts 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_251.wav,102476,and you can just have something to your credit print . 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_252.wav,166412,"Second thing is laziness. Sometimes researchers are very lazy to make efforts, to make the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_253.wav,221836,requisite efforts to produce an original work. Next problem is disinterest. Sometimes a researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_254.wav,221804,"is not interested in the field that he is chosen for research, that researcher has to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_255.wav,145004,make sure that whatever field he has chosen for research is of his interest. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_256.wav,188204,"If it is of his, if it is not of his interest or if it has been imposed upon him by the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_257.wav,181804,"supervisor or the institution etcetera, he may not put in the requisite amount of efforts "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_258.wav,206764,or he may do a half-hearted job. In such scenarios the easiest way of doing work is to plagiarise 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_259.wav,72044,someone else’s work. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_260.wav,191724,The next problem is some other professional commitments. Well the researcher also hav… 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_261.wav,150764,may have some other professional commitments like teaching or some other research works 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_262.wav,180844,"etcetera, or he may be employed in some other place, in such scenarios the research gets "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_263.wav,227212,affected because again the researcher wants to have a easy way out and for the same he 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_264.wav,113356,can use someone else’s work and show it as his own. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_265.wav,254092,"Another problem is, another cause of plagiarism is that it saves time. So, often, very often "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_266.wav,185996,amateur researchers or student researchers or unguided freelance researchers just do 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_267.wav,158732,a research and they try to plagiarise someone else’s work because it is going to save 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_268.wav,190476,"their time and within lesser time they are going to have a research report in their name, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_269.wav,153612,whether that research report is original or not or whether that research report is going 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_270.wav,141516,to be of any use to them or to the society or not is none of their concerns.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_271.wav,187884,They are only concerned with having a credit to a particular research report. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_272.wav,131564,Another problem that researchers often face is the pressure of competitions.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_273.wav,246732,"Well, in today’s age where the research field itself is growing into a very varied field with lots "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_274.wav,181836,"of opportunities and scope, it is very difficult to for a researcher to concentrate and do "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_275.wav,211212,a particular research without having much money in the hands and doing the research ethically.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_276.wav,157196,"For this purpose what the researcher does is, he takes five researches or five research "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_277.wav,200044,works in hand and he can plagiarise material from one research work to another research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_278.wav,189484,"work, this saves his his time and as I said he gets more than one research report to his "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_279.wav,257324,"credit, but that is not an ethical thing to do and that again, it increases the instances of plagiarism. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_280.wav,293484,Last and most important reason for plagiarism to happen is that there are hardly any checks. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_281.wav,196524,"In a country like India where technology is increasingly being used by researchers, even "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_282.wav,183724,"amateur and student researchers to make their research easy, plagiarism has also become "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_283.wav,260524,easy and because plagiarism has become easy it was but a natural consequence that some 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_284.wav,224684,or the other check or balance should have been institutionalized but that has not happened. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_285.wav,229452,"Let us look further whether some institutional checks have been conducted or not till date, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_286.wav,164876,but before that let us look at what are the types of plagiarism. First and foremost and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_287.wav,150732,the most commonest kind is the direct plagiarism. Direct plagiarism means where a person copies 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_288.wav,215116,a whole chunk of some someone else’s work and shows it as his own. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_289.wav,198124,"So, a work may be an idea or a word may be the complete consequence of an idea that is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_290.wav,183724,"the research report or a article etcetera. So, where a person uses someone else’s literary "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_291.wav,193644,"work whether it is in a book or in an article or in a research report etcetera, where that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_292.wav,210924,particular material written by someone else or authored by someone else is used and produced 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_293.wav,107564,as your own it is called as direct plagiarism. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_294.wav,178572,"Another form of plagiarism is indirect plagiarism, wherein the idea of another person is copied. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_295.wav,176044,"Now, one would think that two people can think the same thing that is true. However, the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_296.wav,219596,way of presenting an idea and the way of communicating that idea or the way of converting the idea 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_297.wav,125452,into a particular literary work differs. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_298.wav,163596,"However, sometimes it has it has been seen that a researcher very cleverly change some "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_299.wav,166764,"words here and there, change some certain patterns here and there and produced the idea "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_300.wav,219564,"or the a particular research report of someone else in his own name, saying that it was my "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_301.wav,106924,idea. That kind of plagiarism is called as indirect plagiarism. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_302.wav,202284,"Third and a very common kind of plagiarism is patch writing, patch writing is where a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_303.wav,192012,researcher or let’s say an unethical researcher or a plagiariser uses a whole chunk of anyone 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_304.wav,187916,else’s literary work and puts it in his own research. It may be intentional or it 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_305.wav,188812,may be unintentional that is all up to the researcher but in direct plagiarism the researcher 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_306.wav,211884,"may have used little pieces of information here and there or little pieces of sentences, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_307.wav,177004,"etcetera, here and there from other person’s research. In patch writing a whole paragraph "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_308.wav,199116,"or a whole page etcetera, is completely picked up from the original place and put in the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_309.wav,220812,plagiarised material that is the research work of an unethical researcher. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_310.wav,227564,Another type of plagiarism that happens and it is very rampant is unintended plagiarism. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_311.wav,189836,Unintended plagiarism as the name suggests is not the intention of the plagiariser.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_312.wav,179884,"In that case, the plagiariser or the unethical researcher may have forgotten to cite the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_313.wav,148204,reference or cite the place from which he may have taken a particular information or 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_314.wav,227884,taken a particular literary work. In this case the researcher may not have intended 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_315.wav,102444,but his carelessness is what causes the plagiarism. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_316.wav,195564,"So, that is also not forgivable because where we are talking about professionalism, research "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_317.wav,280044,"is a professionalism. So, in cases of professionalism such kind of carelessness is not neither desirable nor acceptable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_319.wav,185004,"material in his own research work. So, a person may have published something earlier, an article "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_320.wav,216972,"or a research work etcetera, and in subsequent research work he uses his own previously published "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_321.wav,164524,"article. That is that may sound like it is not plagiarism because after all, that person "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_322.wav,205196,"is using his own intellectual product, but the fact is because it has already been published "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_323.wav,126732,he has to either cite it or not use it completely. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_324.wav,193356,"He can take an idea from it, he can get inspired from it, after all it his own work, he cannot "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_325.wav,226924,"plagiarise the whole thing. So, what is the thing that has caused plagiarism the most? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_326.wav,238444,"The answer unfortunately is technology. Technology has been playing well, it has been like a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_327.wav,169644,stepbrother to research because on one hand it has helped to ameliorate the problems of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_328.wav,230124,researchers in a big way. Technology has helped research in a very major way but on the other 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_329.wav,163884,hand technology has been shaking hands with plagiarism also. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_330.wav,184684,"On the one hand it has made plagiarism easy, on the other hand it has given researchers "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_331.wav,247724,the right or the access to a lot of open access content. There is a lot of easy web sharing 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_332.wav,241932,"which helps the researchers to share their content easily via emails or whatever, in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_333.wav,192716,"in whatever way, the technology is helping the researchers to not only share their content "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_334.wav,131532,but also access a lot of scholarly articles. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_335.wav,251244,"For example, a lot of research work is available online today. It is a very common thing to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_336.wav,177996,"not refer to books first, but to go to the internet and see what is available and see "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_337.wav,125772,what is the primary explanation of a particular thing. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_338.wav,201004,"In such a scenario plagiarism has also been made easy because a lot of scholarly articles, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_339.wav,155564,a lot of articles resear… written by research scholars which may or may not be within the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_340.wav,261196,"copyright time period, are available online in an open access fashion. So, this has made "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_341.wav,232044,plagiarism very easy. Plagiarism being easy has become a very tough thing for the researchers 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_342.wav,137004,"to handle, especially those researchers who have been in the research field for a long "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_343.wav,120684,time but are now supervising amateur researchers. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_344.wav,277132,"So, is there any protection against plagiarism or is it all just hot air? The answer is ‘yes’, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_345.wav,193356,"even though plagiarism is an unethical way of doing research, yet it is a legal wrong "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_346.wav,222092,"when it comes to The Copyright Act of nineteen fifty seven. In India, this act protects all "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_347.wav,177004,"kinds of literary works, so a research report or an article or anything that is published "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_369.wav,272076,all the self discipline of the researcher himself which can keep him on the track for 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_370.wav,51884,an ethical research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_17_Research_ethics_371.wav,155884,"Self-discipline is not only in terms of doing an ethical research when it comes to plagiarism, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_2.wav,216396,The learning objective of this particular subject Jurimetrics is Jurimetrics is the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_3.wav,251244,"study of science of law. It is made up of two words- Juris which means law, E-metrics "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_4.wav,231084,which means eco metrics. Jurimetrics is a step towards seeking new alternatives in the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_5.wav,168332,field of legal enquiry and is not to be treated as a science. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_6.wav,281324,"Jurimetrics involves a stricty, strictly empirical approach to the law and examines a wide range "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_7.wav,273676,of scientific and legal topics that are interrelated. The term Jurimetrics was coined by Lee Loevinger 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_8.wav,223372,in the year nineteen forty nine who introduced this word into legal vocabulary later on in

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_13.wav,297004,taken a mechanical term for which the term Jurimetrics become more appropriate. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_14.wav,248684,The Jurimetrics takes the form of different kind of investigations into legal phenomena 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_16.wav,242924,in the olden days was not to eliminate the reasons or philosophy from jurisprudence or 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_17.wav,265324,to find out substitute for necessity values which are an intrinsic part of lawmaking. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_19.wav,268204,methodologies and by using symbolic logics. We as a law student know that law can develop 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_20.wav,257964,only by continuously drawing new values and solutions from the li… life of the community 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_21.wav,226284,and this is achieved partly by the development of new laws and partly by the standards and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_22.wav,235884,principles which are implied in particular branches of law. And we also know that it 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_23.wav,225964,is a legislature which is entrusted with the work of making of the law and it is further 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_24.wav,250924,the lawyers and the judges who are scientifically and intrinsically involved in the study of law. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_25.wav,230764,"So, how can we say or how far the work or, of a judge, task of a judge in developing "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_27.wav,184044,is theory of logical plenitude. What is this logical plenitude theory which the judges 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_29.wav,256684,law is not a mere collection of detailed rules but an organic body of principles with inherent 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_30.wav,173164,scope of growth and flexibility to adapt to new circumstances.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_32.wav,256652,Plenitude is to be used in a way to make it a narrowing force because if a case is decided 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_33.wav,285164,purely by logical deductions from the actual rules then we will crush its growth. The growth 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_34.wav,256364,of the law will be crushed if the logical plenitude theory is applied in strict sense.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_99.wav,239724,Jurimetrics substantially involves the use of quantitative methods in judicial research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_100.wav,159404,Quantitative methods are essentially aids in descriptions. They help to bring out in

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_102.wav,312684,Further they are suited to the handling of large quantities of data and wide range of variables. The bulk 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_103.wav,221804,of the data and the complexity of the variables involved may make it extremely difficult to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_104.wav,251884,handle the data manually and in that circumstance the Jurimetrics and the computer aid becomes very helpful. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_105.wav,239084,With the help of computers it becomes easy and it becomes desirable to use computers 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_106.wav,265004,because it has opened up unprecedented opportunities to look beyond the fragmented terms of unconnected 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_107.wav,268204,knowledge. Quantitative methods are the ways of summarizing the features and relationship in data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_108.wav,222124,"Further, the statistical measures based on the theory of probability go beyond the mere "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_110.wav,247724,Then Jurimetrics though is not a substitute for basic elements of judicial reasoning. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_111.wav,282924,"However, it is helping to put a series of questions that are capable of investigation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_112.wav,263404,"It seeks not sudden relationship or universal laws, but the slow accretion of tested information. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_113.wav,209324,As we have seen in the previous text that though the judicial attitude and judicial

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_115.wav,214444,but computers are getting helpful and all these mechanical tools are becoming aids to

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_117.wav,199084,which can be encountered with the while the use of computers is made. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_118.wav,218604,"Sometimes, it, you know we can divide these approaches into group approach and computer "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_119.wav,171564,"prediction. Now, it is difficult to predict the behavior of individual, but that of mass "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_120.wav,224364,of people is easier. It is also difficult to obtain adequate information about the inner 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_121.wav,218924,working of a group. Also available information with the help of these machines can be misleading. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_122.wav,236844,"When using scientific models which are simplified abstractions of fixed phenomena, the corrections "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_123.wav,105004,that have to be made are also fixed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_124.wav,175404,"That means if errors are fixed, the corrections are also fixed. Where, however, the phenomena "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_125.wav,180844,fluctuates as with human beings. The social phenomena generally are fluctuating and it 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_126.wav,222444,is impossible to know what corrections need to be made and for what purpose these models 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_127.wav,216364,"becomes useless. Further, the computer prediction so far as there is a consistency in decision "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_128.wav,249964,and attitude the prediction of judicial opinions by computers become possible through fact studies.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_129.wav,192684,Fact studies means the acceptance of a fact by an appellate court rested on identifiable 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_130.wav,219244,conditions surrounding the way in which it was presented to the trial court. If the accepted 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_131.wav,250284,"facts are combined in certain ways, the decision will go in one way. Then attitude studies. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_132.wav,231404,Attitude is nowadays is capable of being scaled by means of scalogram. A person who reacts 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_133.wav,208684,positively to a weak stimulus will definitely react similarly to another weaker stimulus. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_134.wav,197484,"If the line of cases can be made to scale in this way, a set of values can be shown "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_135.wav,206156,to be shared by members of that court thereby making the future behavior predictable.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_136.wav,201932,"That means once a person's attitude is one type of, in one situation, the chances are it is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_137.wav,192684,"going on to be the similar or same in another situation. However, any attempt at prediction "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_138.wav,209324,seem to fail because this is a very technical and typical type of situation the behavior 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_139.wav,185644,will remain same because the personal element just cannot be eliminated from judicial decisions 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_140.wav,128364,and everything depends on how facts are viewed and stated. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_141.wav,213804,The same set of facts can be stated in different combinations and at different levels of generality. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_142.wav,206124,No mechanical aid can predict such combination or levels as is likely to be chosen.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_143.wav,288684,Different ratios can be extracted from a decision depending on whether the later court wishes to see resemblance 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_144.wav,203564,or differences. Then predictability of judicial decisions also depends upon the consistency 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_145.wav,245804,"of the judges, their attitude, their behavior, their values and people’s attitude, people, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_146.wav,151724,"judges are also people, people's attitude changes with age and experience. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_148.wav,170284,"can only work on the basis of reported decisions, the majority of which are essentially those "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_149.wav,232364,of lower court and they are unreported and the judges in their decision-making at times 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_150.wav,113644,refer to even those unreported judgments also. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_151.wav,226572,A computer analysis indicating a judge's decision can distract the judges from the judicial

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_157.wav,162924,The structure of the judiciary in our country is pyramidical in nature and the Supreme Court 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_158.wav,197164,of India is the highest judicial forum and final court of appeal. Article one thirty

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_162.wav,250924,"Then, now let's talk about the judicial behavior of the judges of the Supreme Court of India "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_163.wav,216684,"and then the use of Jurimetrics. The judge’s philosophy, which is reflected in the judicial "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_164.wav,206124,"pronouncement. Just, Benjamin Cardozo in his classical work, Nature of Judicial Process "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_165.wav,250604,mentioned various factors which influence judicial functioning and the behavior is one of them. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_166.wav,194284,It is always a social and political background of the judges which is relevant in explaining 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_167.wav,227564,in explaining the decision-making behavior. There are dynamics theories of judicial process. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_168.wav,208044,The picture of the judges as a policy oriented decision-maker who drives his premises both 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_169.wav,191084,from within and outside the courtroom and whose functions are exceeding the mechanical

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_171.wav,207084,"Theories does not specify the precise nature of the relationship between judge’s background, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_172.wav,171564,"his experience and his judicial work, which definitely makes an important part while a "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_173.wav,177324,judge gives a decision. The judicial decision cannot be explained solely in terms of social 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_174.wav,210284,background itself. There is a philosophy and psychology of the judges which is more helpful

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_176.wav,186636,according to the philosophical current in the minds of the judges. The social views 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_177.wav,194924,and legal philosophy of the judge are often powerful forces both in shaping of the law 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_178.wav,105324,and administration of the judiciary. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_179.wav,258924,The subjectivity of an individual judge plays the most important role in the deciding of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_180.wav,213164,cases because the inherent morality which is embedded in a judge's subconscious mind 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_181.wav,263084,"gives the law the dynamic character. Every judge has his or her own, his or her own perception "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_182.wav,303084,of what the law is and the law functions and that is what is undertaking to be implemented.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_188.wav,164524,being the judge of the Supreme Court or the High Courts is definitely going on to reflect 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_189.wav,82604,while the judge is giving a judgment. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_190.wav,256364,Then human factors and the environment is definitely an important aspect in the judicial decisions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_191.wav,146924,The personality of a judge plays an important part in the process of their 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_192.wav,210924,adjudication on particular cases and has to be taken into account as an innumerable part 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_193.wav,228524,of the case. As a child the judge who was born into a human community that is already 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_194.wav,216684,experienced and classified and almost endless number of situations and the behaviors which 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_195.wav,103084,are appropriate to each situation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_196.wav,240684,"The, guidelines derived from all this experience and all these situations are imparted "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_197.wav,275884,"to the child as he develops and matures. When as an adult the judge is faced with a situation, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_198.wav,205164,the preconscious and the subconscious screening and the typing of the situation and rules 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_199.wav,210604,of behavior occur and this affects the person's particular personality and behavior.  
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_200.wav,236844,"Because judges are also men from diversified backgrounds, while they are interpreting the Constitution, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_201.wav,244204,they are inferring out of their experience and their ideal of the social order. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_202.wav,190124,"We have, I think, being the law students we have noticed various judgments, various judges, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_219.wav,204524,complex phenomenon. The social attitude and values preferences of judges are reflected 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_220.wav,211884,in the opinions they write and the vote they cast for or against a particular judgement. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_221.wav,209932,One of the prerequisites for studying such differences among the judges is that the individualistic 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_222.wav,207436,"behavior of each judge must reveal certain recurrent pattern, uniformities and consistencies "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_225.wav,136396,limited success in it because of certain reasons. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_226.wav,162924,One of the reason is the short tenure of the judges which leads to rapid turnover in the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_227.wav,203884,court making it just difficult to observe their respective behavior over a reasonable 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_228.wav,238764,"period of time. However, we see the examples of recent examples of minority and majority "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_229.wav,205804,judgement that reflects the behavior and the background of the judges. The frequent use 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_230.wav,194924,of small panels which consist of two or three judges to dispose of bulk of the work of the

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_235.wav,199404,"this lecture, we can say that in order to analyze judgements you need some insight into "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_236.wav,191724,the decision-making process of a judge. Since very little has been written by the judges

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_14_Jurimetrics_242.wav,208364,and perhaps in the prediction and formulation of judicial decisions. Jurimetrics does not

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_93.wav,210284,of aptitude and ability tests as exemplified by the Stanford Binet and various group tests. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_94.wav,203884,Following World War Two there were comparable developments in the area of personality testing 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_95.wav,119724,with projective technique receiving the most prominent attention.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_119.wav,154316,The respondent is not faced with a set of limited alternatives. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_120.wav,180844,The emphasis is on respondent’s perception and the meaning given to the subject matter. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_121.wav,148812,The individual has not to talk directly about himself or herself. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_122.wav,173196,"So, the purpose of the test is not indicated to the individual. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_123.wav,218572,The responses are interpreted as indicating the individuals own view of the word. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_124.wav,168364,The individuals response are not taken at face value that is with the meaning that this 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_125.wav,209996,subject presumably would expect them to have have but are interpreted in terms of some 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_126.wav,242924,pre-established psychological conceptuals of what responses to the specific test situation mean. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_127.wav,160364,"The interpretation considers responses not in isolation, but is respect to patterns. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_128.wav,264044,The tester attempts to arrive at a psychological coherent picture of the individual by delivering 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_129.wav,214124,the full meaning of any particular response from the total record of the person’s replies. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_130.wav,208044,"So, given these general remarks concerning the nature and origin of projective techniques, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_131.wav,299884,it may be helpful to provide concrete identification of the intu… instruments by means of representative illustration. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_132.wav,140812,"So, for doing that we will be classifying the projective techniques. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_133.wav,205484,"There are many different approaches to classify these tests, but the most useful approach "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_134.wav,165196,focuses on the nature of the response evoked from the subject. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_135.wav,193964,"On this basis, projective technique may be grouped broadly into the following categories "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_136.wav,211852,"first, association, second, construction, third, completion, fourth, choice or ordering "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_137.wav,93484,"and finally, expression. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_138.wav,222796,"First, association – Included association techniques are those instruments that tend "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_139.wav,153964,to minimize ideation and emphasize immediacy of response. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_140.wav,205772,The subject is instructed not to reflect but rather to respond to the stimulus with the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_141.wav,149484,"first word, image or percept that occurs to him. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_142.wav,117516,In this there is one concept called word association. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_143.wav,210572,"An early and well known example is the word association technique, which involves the "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_144.wav,214764,"oral presentation of a series of disconnected word, one at a time, to which the subject "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_145.wav,147244,is instructed to respond with the first word that occurs to him. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_146.wav,207436,"Typically, both the subjects association and reaction time to each word are recorded. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_147.wav,220812,Word association test can take many forms as there is no single excepted list of words. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_148.wav,204204,"Simply put, when using this type of test, the assessor would read a list of words, asking "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_149.wav,210284,the participant to write down the very first that comes to mind after each.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_152.wav,212204,"As you might guess, there are some words that are common on such a test like mother, father, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_153.wav,101804,"and sex, being at the top of this list. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_357.wav,215084,The similar methods in expressive techniques are role play and drawing and painting.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_364.wav,209964,The limitations of projective technique method is that the information derived about subjects 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_365.wav,108524,personality characteristics is indirectly or inferred. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_366.wav,166092,Against this the techniques personality questionnaire gives more direct information. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_367.wav,148204,The difference between the projective test and personality questionnaire is that the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_368.wav,213836,"items in the personality questionnaire are structured and they being free from any ambiguity, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_370.wav,153004,The difference in the response made by the different subject is no way determined by 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_371.wav,192684,difference in their perception and understanding of the given items. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_372.wav,200044,"On the other hand, in projective test, the stimulus is unstructured, ambiguous and unclear. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_373.wav,182444,"The responses in the projective test tell nothing directly about the subject, they constitute "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_374.wav,123212,a description of the stimuli. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_375.wav,97356,Project test lack the objectivity of the personality test. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_376.wav,154572,"Since, the subject does not think that his personality is being assessed, it does not "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_377.wav,124524,motivate him to give a fake response. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_378.wav,168396,"And the as we have discussed the limitations of this method, there are few advantage also "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_379.wav,35884,of these method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_380.wav,199692,The projective test assumption that the individual responses to ambiguous stimulus presented 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_381.wav,161036,to him reflects significant and relatively enduring personality attributes. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_382.wav,206764,The advantage of this technique is that it is relatively disguised and therefore non-reactive 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_383.wav,146604,compared with more obtrusive self report measures. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_384.wav,207084,The respondents cannot in infer with answer will produce the desired impressions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_385.wav,270444,"In spite of their best intention, the subjects maybe unable to describe their feelings and "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_386.wav,195244,attributes as accuracy as they may be discerned in the projective test situation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_387.wav,219244,"For example, when the students are asked, “What are the qualities of a good and bad teacher?” "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_388.wav,58924,They may not freely point out these qualities. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_389.wav,205804,"But, when they are show me some pictures, situations of teachers, and are asked to point "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_391.wav,116204,"They will feel more, more free to give their choices. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_392.wav,208364,Projective test produce more extensive information than a questionnaire or even an interview. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_393.wav,176364,"Sometimes seeking access to subjects for the study, it’s difficult when the object is "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_394.wav,238444,"made explicit to them, but it, if it is not very obvious, the permission may be easily granted. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_395.wav,152364,The evidence suggests that the information about respond’s personality trait is obscured 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_396.wav,185324,by information about the respondent’s temporary state and by random noise produced by the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_397.wav,41644,ambiguity to the procedure. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_398.wav,186604,"It may, therefore be said that projective techniques have not produced satisfactory "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_399.wav,169324,results and seems unlikely to match the widespread use of questionnaire. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_400.wav,148524,"So, in the end, we can only say that projective techniques and their application represent "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_401.wav,249324,"a point of significant intersection for psychology psychoanalytical theory, clinical psychology, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_405.wav,216364,"them from other personality measures, such as inventories, ratings, or situation test. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_406.wav,184044,The most distinct feature of projective techniques concerns the presentation to the subject of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_407.wav,103724,a task that is relatively unstructured. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_408.wav,209964,This lack of structure involves the ambiguous or vaguely defined stimuli and a relatively 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_409.wav,173804,unrestricted set of responses alternative by means of which the subject may assign meaning 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_410.wav,57644,to the stimulus material. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_411.wav,168044,It is generally assumed that in the process of choosing between the many alternatives 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_412.wav,189164,"the structuring or interpreting the ambiguous stimulus material, the subject reveals significant "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_413.wav,73324,and fundamental aspect of himself.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_416.wav,71404,concerning the purpose of test. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_417.wav,161324,The response data are typically profuse and often involves fantasy or imaginary crenation. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_418.wav,204844,The instruments are highly multidimensional that is they are intended to provide information 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_419.wav,103724,concerning a large number of personality dimensions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_420.wav,203564,"So, one may conclude that if projective technique represents the royal road to the unconscious, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_29_Projective_Technique_421.wav,157804,the necessary roadmaps have yet to become common knowledge.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_15.wav,198732,By this term design we can easily understand this is the shape of research and this shape

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_12.wav,201996,"So, Content Analysis is a technique of interpreting various kinds of textual material to arrive "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_13.wav,64332,at a valid inference. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_14.wav,237516,It analyzes various documents systematically and converts qualitative datas into a quantitative data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_15.wav,211564,"This method is commonly used in social sciences, but has recently gained property in other discipline as well. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_16.wav,177004,Content Analysis is a method of summarizing the various aspects of contents in the form

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_21.wav,155564,"So Content Analysis is one of the classical procedure for analyzing textual material, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_22.wav,100844,be it interview or media products. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_23.wav,194924,"It differs from coding in the sense that rather than generating categories from the data themselves, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_24.wav,213804,it uses categories brought from the outside and fits the empirical materially against

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_26.wav,161644,"Content Analysis, though it often analyzes written words is a quantitative method. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_27.wav,141484,The result of Content Analysis are numbers and percentage. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_28.wav,163884,So it can be used in giving results both in quantitative as well as qualitative form. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_29.wav,193644,One of the best example of Content Analysis is the analysis done by some researcher during

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_85.wav,119724,Let us discuss some characteristics of Content Analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_86.wav,119724,Gardner has referred to four characteristics of Content Analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_87.wav,165484,They are objectivity that is carrying out analysis on the basis of explicitly formulated 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_88.wav,238124,"rules, which will enable two or more persons to obtain the same results from the same documents. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_89.wav,196524,"Secondly, systematic, that is including and excluding the content or categories according "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_90.wav,124204,to consistency applied criteria of selection. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_91.wav,214732,This eliminated analysis in which only materials sup… supporting the investigators hypothesis are examined. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_92.wav,162316,"Third is generality, that is findings must have theoretical relevance. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_93.wav,184044,"Purely descriptive information about content, unrelated to other attributes of content or "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_96.wav,261132,"Then is quantification, that is the answers of the question raised should be a quantitative terms. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_97.wav,194956,Some scholars like Kaplan and Goldsen equate the term quantitative with numerical that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_98.wav,127404,is classifying content in prescribed numerical terms. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_99.wav,178284,This means that inferences must be derived strictly from counts of frequency. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_100.wav,211244,It also means that information should be conveyed as “Forty percent people or forty out of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_101.wav,209004,"hundred people had this opinion,” because it is more precise than the statement “less "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_106.wav,130284,tabulation of frequency has been criticized on a number of grounds. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_107.wav,224044,"One, the most important argument is that such a restriction leads to a bias in the selection "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_109.wav,173164,Undue emphasis is placed on precision at the cost of the problem significance. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_110.wav,241964,Other arguments is that more meaningful inferences can be drawn by non-quantitative measure. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_111.wav,190124,Qualitative analysis is more superior to the problems of applied social sciences. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_112.wav,217964,The proponent of qualitative techniques also question the assumption of the proponent of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_113.wav,50604,the qualitative technique. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_114.wav,316524,"For purpose of inferences, frequency of assertion is necessarily related to the importance of assumption. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_115.wav,169964,"They, that is proponent of the qualitative techniques, say that the single appearance "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_116.wav,285804,or omission of an attribute to in a document may be or of more significance than the relative

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_137.wav,143724,The research through Content Analysis involves four methods. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_138.wav,277804,"One, specifying the problem, two, sampling, three, choosing units for analysis, four, category construction. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_145.wav,150444,D – What are the geographical areas of their concentration? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_146.wav,108204,Which political party support different caste? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_147.wav,229804,F – Whom do the Naxalites support and how has the the support increased the intensity of violence? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_148.wav,197164,G – What has been the role of police and paramilitary forces in controlling violence? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_149.wav,225004,Spelling out these and other similar questions enable a researcher to narrow down his focus 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_150.wav,126124,so that he can collect data around these questions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_151.wav,203244,"The problem has also to be specified theoretically in terms of the theories on collective violence, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_152.wav,211212,"political behavior, mutual interdependence of caste and jajmani system, formation of "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_154.wav,79404,on the caste basis and so on. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_155.wav,220524,Logically this will determine the attention of the researchers to the kind of data sources 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_156.wav,184972,"that is books and journals dealing with these themes, say, caste and politics in India, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_157.wav,136716,"jajmani system, collective violence, police and violence, and so forth. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_158.wav,268204,These books and journals will provide an opportunity to the researcher for more rigorous comparative 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_159.wav,68844,and theoretical analysis than data source might. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_160.wav,177324,"So, sampling here refers to the sampling of newspaper, magazines and books, TV serial "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_168.wav,185324,This sampled material will enable researcher to give some elegant theoretical statements. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_169.wav,193292,It should be remembered that sampling in the case of Content Analysis is a multistage process. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_170.wav,168044,"Even when the researcher decides to focus on specific magazines and journals, will he "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_171.wav,140556,be able to go through all the issues of the magazines of last fifty years.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_173.wav,167372,five hundred issues of each of the eight or ten magazines mentioned above? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_174.wav,200716,"Therefore, money and manpower requires the sampling to be confined to specific period "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_175.wav,50604,in multistage process. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_176.wav,94124,"So, choosing the unit of analysis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_177.wav,203884,"After determining the sampled material for scrutiny, the question arises, what exactly "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_178.wav,82572,ought to be the unit for analysis? 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_179.wav,167756,"Should unit of analysis be words like violence, aggression, etcetera., sentences, paragraphs, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_181.wav,212844,"Researchers have to setup categories for tabulation, the theme, persons, behavior, and so on. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_182.wav,117484,Gardner has pointed out following units of analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_183.wav,267564,"First, the single word, this is used more ris… more on research in psychotherapy and literary direction. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_190.wav,244492,Category construction – This refers to the classifying the content of the material being investigated. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_191.wav,199724,The constructed category must reflect the major theoretical concepts on which the study is based. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_192.wav,171564,"For example, in the illustration of caste violence some useful category should be status "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_251.wav,140204,Sanders and Pinhey have suggested five types of Content Analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_252.wav,231404,"First, word counting analysis, second, conceptual analysis, semantic analysis, evaluative assertion "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_254.wav,184044,All these types of Content Analysis can be explained beautifully with the help of examples 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_255.wav,120012,explained by Ram Ahuja in his book on Research Methodology. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_256.wav,233004,Word counting analysis – This is counting the use of certain keywords in different texts. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_257.wav,161036,"For example, one can count the word ‘democracy’ and ‘totalitarianism’ to measure the degree "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_272.wav,169644,Semantic analysis – In this the researcher would be interested not only in the type of 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_273.wav,223724,"words used, but also in scaling their intensity weights, like using weak and strong words, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_274.wav,81644,"positive and negative words, and so on. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_275.wav,198444,"For positive and strong word, plus score would be used and for negative and weak words, minus "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_276.wav,39084,score would be used. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_277.wav,170604,"For example, love plus two, dislike minus one, and so on. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_278.wav,214124,"Measuring these positive and negative scores, community’s feeling can be assessed through Content Analysis. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_279.wav,116204,Then then is evaluation assertion analysis.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_283.wav,181196,"And finally, contextual analysis – This is to, this is used to predict future verbal "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_284.wav,157772,behavior based on the analysis of known words and concepts. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_285.wav,188236,"For example, by use of words like militant, firing, bombing, explosion, etcetera., one "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_286.wav,141452,can establish scale for known verbal behavior. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_287.wav,121036,Sarantakos has indicated five types of Content Analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_288.wav,216364,First one is descriptive analysis- Where analysis means counting the frequency in appearance 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_289.wav,189772,of certain elements of the research question and comparing it with the other element. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_290.wav,208364,Second is categorical analysis- Where analysis involves a study of the documents by means 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_291.wav,238124,"of set of categories producing nominal as well as ordinal and interval data, which are "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_292.wav,68204,then processed statistically. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_293.wav,235276,Intensity analysis- Which is processed by means of multi-step scales based on theoretical criteria. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_294.wav,190412,Then contingency analysis- Which is basically a semantic analysis that is usually employed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_295.wav,157196,to make an inference from the text about the personality of the author. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_296.wav,227852,"And finally, contextual analysis- Where sequence in which concept appears together is examined. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_297.wav,166540,"The systematic appearance is not considered accidental, but it expresses the, a thinking "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_298.wav,32044,pattern of the author. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_300.wav,182732,"Summarizing the Content Analysis – Here the material is paraphrased, that is omitting "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_301.wav,199724,less relevant passages or those having the same meaning are reduced. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_302.wav,177036,"Thus, the material becomes more coherent, economical, and manageable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_303.wav,226572,It is a kind of editing of the material in the order to draw out its essence. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_304.wav,101836,Explicable Content Analysis – This work in opposite way. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_305.wav,216044,"Here, statements which are puzzling, contradictory, or unclear are explained or clear clarified "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_306.wav,180204,by keeping in mind their context or by looking for clues in other parts of the text that 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_307.wav,105612,would help make their meaning clear. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_308.wav,169004,Then structuring Content Analysis – Here the researcher looks for type or formal structure 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_309.wav,207084,in the material by applying categories that emerged at the stage of formulating the research 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_310.wav,88044,"question itself, and organizing the material accordingly. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_311.wav,209676,"Thus, qualitative Content Analysis helps the researcher to reduce to manageable level large "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_312.wav,208364,"masses of text using a uniform scheme of categories, which also helps the comparison of different "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_313.wav,90892,cases to which is applied throughout. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_314.wav,211564,"According to Berelson, following five procedures can be used to determine the objectivity in "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_315.wav,32044,Content Analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_316.wav,72684,First is the rule guide procedure. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_317.wav,186284,It may be said that the objectivity in Content Analysis requires three criti… criteria. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_318.wav,181164,What is important is not the categories developed by researcher for analyzing the content material 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_319.wav,172524,"or the procedures adopted for placing a unit of communication in one or another category, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_320.wav,219564,but to spell out the rules and methods used by the researcher so that it could be evaluated 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_321.wav,119724,how conclusion wo… were reached. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_322.wav,149836,"Secondly, systematic procedure- Besides the rule guiding procedure, which could be replicated "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_323.wav,190092,by other researchers adopted the adopting the systematic procedure also contributes 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_324.wav,113324,to the objectivity of the Content Analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_325.wav,173196,"Then, quantitative description- Counting the frequencies appearing in different papers, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_326.wav,142732,magazines and communications and comparing their validity is essential. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_327.wav,131244,This is to assess the intensity of a particular variable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_328.wav,174156,Qualitative data becomes more valid when it is quantitatively assessed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_329.wav,65612,Focus on the qualitative analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_330.wav,216364,Merely concentrating on counting the frequency in Content Analysis will be missing the overall 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_331.wav,81996,sense of a body of communication. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_332.wav,224332,"Therefore, both quantitative and qualitative technique must be used in conjunction with one another. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_333.wav,110444,Assessing only the manifest content of communication. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_334.wav,161964,"It has already been stated that besides the manifest content, there could be the latent "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_335.wav,205516,content too in which the researcher has to read between the lines and give meaning to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_336.wav,88332,to it as he perceives it. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_337.wav,71724,This affects the objectivity of the analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_338.wav,235884,"It is, therefore, necessary that emphasis be given only what appears explicitly in communication. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_339.wav,196204,This does not mean that the researcher will totally refrain from engaging in any interpretation 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_340.wav,53836,of the material studied. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_341.wav,128364,"Without interpretation, how could content be analyzed? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_342.wav,208044,Then let’s discuss the advantage and disadvantages of the Content Analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_343.wav,118092,Ram Ahuja has given following advantages and disadvantages of Content Analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_344.wav,229516,One of the significant advantage of Content Analysis is that it is thoroughly unobtrusive 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_345.wav,121932,method that is it has no effect on the subject being studied. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_346.wav,176364,"In other methods like interview, observation, experiment, etcetera., the researcher is directly "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_347.wav,83884,involved with the person. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_348.wav,227916,Content Analysis eliminates the source of responses bias that threatens research whenever 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_349.wav,123244,the respondents are directly questioned or observed. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_350.wav,188812,It can be used as a reliable central technique in historical research concerned with the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_351.wav,198764,particular period or with friends over time by studying people who are no longer available 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_352.wav,54764,to answer the questions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_353.wav,200044,"Thirdly, it makes possible to a possible a variety of cross cultural studies that would "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_354.wav,143724,likely be unfeasible using the other methods. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_355.wav,287084,"And finally, it can be used to test preliminary ideas, hypothesis or theories prior to a more complete investigation. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_356.wav,141164,It is powerful tool for evaluating personal social values. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_357.wav,196876,People are more candid while writing down the thoughts than when confrontely it by interviewer 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_358.wav,54092,or a questionnaire. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_359.wav,177324,"Therefore, studying society where people are more literate, Content Analysis proves to "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_360.wav,53484,be a more reliable method of research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_361.wav,207436,Thit… met… This method is more useful when research budget is small and resources are limited. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_362.wav,126092,It is easier to repeat the study through this method. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_363.wav,151404,Repetition of study through other method may not be feasible either because the event under 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_364.wav,180524,"study may no longer exist or because of cost, time, and money. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_365.wav,176044,"Since, Content Analysis is a heavily planned method, it lacks the spontaneity and unplanned "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_366.wav,60524,qualities of field research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_367.wav,60524,Determining validity is difficult. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_368.wav,215404,"For example, did the newspaper give the real values and feelings of the workers during the strike? "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_369.wav,32044,Probably not. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_370.wav,182796,Some required documents may not be available to the researcher which may affect the conclusion 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_371.wav,96972,and it is susceptible to coder bias. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_372.wav,116844,In this module we have understood the concept of Content Analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_373.wav,202924,It is a technique of interpreting various kinds of textual material to arrive at valid inference. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_374.wav,173484,It analyzes various documents systematically and converts qualitative data into quantitative data. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_375.wav,169964,We have also understood various types of Content Analysis and the various steps that are to 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_376.wav,105004,be taken during the process of Content Analysis. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_377.wav,186316,"Finally, we see some advantages and disadvantages of this, but this is the best method that "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_378.wav,186252,can be adopted for making any kind of qualitative research into a quantitative research and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_27_Content_Analysis_379.wav,188204,it is nowadays used very much in various kinds of social sciences and communication sciences.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_12.wav,160044,Then we will be understanding the need of measurement and scaling technique and also 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_13.wav,91884,when and where to use these techniques. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_14.wav,157164,While understanding scaling as a technique we will also understand various types of scales 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_15.wav,206444,"with special reference to the rating and ranking order scale, which we often use in our research. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_16.wav,144684,Then we will be discussing the precautions and limitations of rating scales and finally 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_17.wav,169932,we will discuss the various methods in rank order scales. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_18.wav,137036,"So, when, while talking about the measurement. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_19.wav,140204,"In our daily life, we only distinguish the characters and qualities of things and on "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_22.wav,79756,be differentiated from one another. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_23.wav,213164,"Propositions affirming qualitative differences are the first fruits of enquiry in any sciences, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_24.wav,166444,it is more necessary to know the magnitude of such difference precisely. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_25.wav,172204,This is required for the accuracy of statement and for discovering comprehensive principles 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_26.wav,165164,on the basis of which the subject matter can be known to be systematically related.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_197.wav,107244,A scale must be reliable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_198.wav,161612,The following methods that we have already discussed in our module on reliability and 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_199.wav,141804,validity can be used to test the reliability of a scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_200.wav,205836,"Like, first is retest method - According to this method the same scale is applied twice "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_202.wav,80652,the scale is regarded as reliable. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_203.wav,149516,"For this matter, the test can be done on two similar groups also. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_204.wav,184044,Second is multiple forms - According to this technique two types of scales are constructed 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_205.wav,62412,and they are applied to the same population. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_206.wav,195916,"In case the two results are more or less similar, the scales maybe regarded as reliable. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_207.wav,249004,"Third is split half method - In this method, the scale may be divided into two equal parts. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_215.wav,201004,First is logical validity - The scale must confirm to the common sense reasoning and

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_217.wav,60844,may be helpful. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_218.wav,151724,"Second is unknown groups - In this method, the scale is applied to the known category "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_219.wav,153644,"of people, then the result obtained is compared with the known facts. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_220.wav,113964,If they are similar the scale is considered to be valid. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_221.wav,200364,"Third, opinion of Jury - This method depends on the considered opinion of many Juries, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_222.wav,73004,who will have no bias. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_223.wav,211244,"If several Juries give the same opinion, the method of measurement may be considered as valid. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_224.wav,221804,"Fourth, independent method - A thing maybe separately measured separately with the separate "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_225.wav,189164,"independent criteria and if the result are similar, the scale may be said to be valid. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_226.wav,204524,"However, these methods of testing and validity of a scale are not free from flaws, thus, "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_228.wav,159404,The scaling method is used when the researcher wishes to utilise simultaneously a number 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_229.wav,67244,of observation on a respondent. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_230.wav,161324,A number of difficulties maybe encountered by the researcher in arranging the meaningful 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_231.wav,179564,responses logically and incorporating the responses in the analysis of attitude.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_233.wav,176684,"but they are related matters, it is very difficult to objectively interpret validity. "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_235.wav,81644,by testing the criteria itself. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_236.wav,162924,The validity maybe for the future that is predictive validity or for the present that

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_238.wav,185004,"So, there is need for the scaling technique and the, when and where to use. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_239.wav,180844,The difficulty of applying rigorous and objective test in attitude measurement arises from the 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_240.wav,225004,fact that such measurement is indirect for attitude is inferred from verbal responses. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_241.wav,277484,An attitude is an abstraction and as such it is almost impossible to assess its validity directly.

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_265.wav,209324,"There are the following four main types of scales- nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_266.wav,136364,"We will be discussing each of it, it in detail. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_267.wav,194604,A nominal scale - A nominal scale consists of two or more named category into which individual 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_268.wav,88364,objects or responses are classified. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_269.wav,221804,"In a nominal scale, it is possible to distinguish two or more categories relating to the specified attributes. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_270.wav,220204,The members of these categories differ with respect to the specified attribute which is the measure. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_271.wav,126764,It is a simple method of classification rather than arrangement along a continuum. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_272.wav,189804,The question of dimensions is not important in this type of scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_273.wav,177964,"If desired, the difference, different groups maybe numbered. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_274.wav,156844,Classification of individual according to religion is an example of nominal scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_275.wav,190764,"Then comes the Ordinal Scale - In this type of scale numbers, example one, two, three, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_276.wav,167084,etcetera are assigned to indicate the only the relative position. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_277.wav,208044,"The scale purpose is to give ranks to the individual along the specified continuum, "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_278.wav,215404,but such a scale like the nominal scale does not measure the distance between the positions. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_279.wav,201324,"In this scale, it is very essential to determine the order of position in terms of more or "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_280.wav,199404,"less, better or worse and so on in relation to the attribute which is being measured. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_281.wav,137324,"For instance, X is regarded as more beautiful than Y. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_282.wav,227884,"The ordinal scale can indicate only a person’s relative position, but it cannot cardinally "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_283.wav,93484,measure the difference between the persons. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_284.wav,197804,"One can say, for example, X is greater than Y, but he cannot say by how much. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_285.wav,186604,Third is Interval or Cardinal Scale - This scale has equal units of measurement. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_286.wav,229484,"Thus, it is possible to interpret not only the order of scale scores but also the distance between them. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_287.wav,239404,"Thus, two persons with scale position four and five are as far apart as two person with "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_289.wav,191724,A person having the score of ten cannot be regarded as two times higher or better than 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_290.wav,76844,a person whose score is five. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_291.wav,201324,"When we talk of ten degree Celsius rise in temperature, it does not mean that it is twice "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_292.wav,86764,as hot as five degree Celsius. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_293.wav,138284,"In an Interval scale, the intervals remains the equal. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_294.wav,187564,Then comes the Ratio Scale - This scale incorporates the properties of an interval scale together 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_295.wav,114284,with the fixed origin or zero point. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_296.wav,155884,"Weight, length and time are obvious example of ratio scales. "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_297.wav,178924,"On the basis of ratio scale, one can compare both difference in scores and the relative "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_298.wav,37804,magnitude of score. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_299.wav,150124,"For instance, the difference between ten and fifteen minutes is the same as the difference "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_300.wav,221164,between fifteen and twenty minutes and ten minutes is twice as long as five minutes. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_301.wav,196204,"Then comes the Rating Scale - Another important type of scale which is, which is often used "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_302.wav,50924,in everyday life. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_303.wav,188204,"The rating, ranking and attitude scales have one common method of assigning numerical position "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_305.wav,218284,"While preparing a rating scale, the rater places the individual at a particular point "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_306.wav,148524,along a continuum and a numerical value is attached to this point. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_307.wav,140524,The following are the main types of rating scales used in research. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_308.wav,185964,First is Graphic Rating Scale - This is most common used rating scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_309.wav,224044,"Under this method, the rater indicates his rating by putting a tick at the point selected "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_310.wav,266284,by him on the line chosen or measuring an attribute any specific point from lowest to the highest. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_311.wav,161644,The different scale point may indicate brief descri… descriptions about attitude level. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_312.wav,101804,This may help the rater to indicate his own preferences. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_313.wav,100524,The following is the example of a graphic rating scale. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_314.wav,197804,"We can, from one to five we can place it like this, one means he feels strongly for the "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_316.wav,214124,"Two means generally feels the necessity for participation, three means part, partly favours "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_318.wav,198444,"Forth means generally feels no necessity of participation, five means feels no necessity "
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_319.wav,65004,of participation at all. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_320.wav,279404,The rater may mark anyone of five points to indicate his own rating and thereby may reveal his preferences. 
/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_321.wav,179884,"The graphic rating scale is a very simple and convenient device to use, it ensures a "

/home/bit/Documents/data_processing/program/Audio-Split/sliced_audio/Module_22_Scaling_323.wav,162604,"In the rating scale, vague, unlikely and extreme statement should be avoided. "
