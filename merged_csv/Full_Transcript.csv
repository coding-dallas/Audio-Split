Module_24_Reliability_0,429,1429,Hello friends! 
Module_24_Reliability_1,1429,2820,I am Dr. Ritu Sharma. 
Module_24_Reliability_2,2820,5390,"I am faculty at National Law University, Delhi. "
Module_24_Reliability_3,5390,10130,"We are here as a part of MOOCs programme, you must have gone through the various modules "
Module_24_Reliability_4,10130,12350,on MOOCs and other subjects. 
Module_24_Reliability_5,12350,17610,"Today also, we are going to talk about, as a part of MOOCs programme, we are going to "
Module_24_Reliability_6,17610,23360,"talk about reliability and validity, which is a very important concept of research methodology. "
Module_24_Reliability_7,23360,29260,You will be needing this concept again and again in all types of research that you carry out. 
Module_24_Reliability_8,29260,34120,"So, while understanding the concept of reliability and validity, we will be talking about the "
Module_24_Reliability_9,34120,36829,meaning and definitions of reliability and validity. 
Module_24_Reliability_10,36829,42690,"We will also be discussing about the types of reliability, we will understand how to "
Module_24_Reliability_11,42690,46210,reach the reliability of qualitative datas. 
Module_24_Reliability_12,46210,51010,And then we will go onto the discussing the concept of validity and what relationship 
Module_24_Reliability_13,51010,53219,does reliability has with validity. 
Module_24_Reliability_14,53219,59690,"So, when we talk about the concept of reliability, in simple term, the concept of reliability "
Module_24_Reliability_15,59690,66110,means the extent to which a measurement procedure gives the same results however and whenever 
Module_24_Reliability_16,66110,67520,it is carried out. 
Module_24_Reliability_17,67520,72000,Validity is the con… extent to which it gives the correct results. 
Module_24_Reliability_18,72000,76640,"So there is a, they are very famous scholars named Kirk and Miller. "
Module_24_Reliability_19,76640,80020,They are given a beautiful example of physical world. 
Module_24_Reliability_20,80020,85771,"For example, a thermometer shows the same reading of eighty two degree celsius every "
Module_24_Reliability_21,85771,89049,"time we plugged in, in a boiling water. "
Module_24_Reliability_22,89049,91810,It is obviously a reliable thermometer. 
Module_24_Reliability_23,91810,97470,But a thermometer that gives different reading near about hundred Celsius each time it is 
Module_24_Reliability_24,97470,103180,"placed in boiling water may not be reliable, but it is certainly quite valid. "
Module_24_Reliability_25,103180,109860,"So in other words, validity refers to the true or exact value of a finding. "
Module_24_Reliability_26,109860,117799,Any research that wants to be called as objective has to be both reliable as well as valid. 
Module_24_Reliability_27,117799,123000,"So according to Oxford Dictionary, when we talk about reliability, reliability is the "
Module_24_Reliability_28,123000,129379,"degree to which the results of a measurement, calculation or specification can be dependent "
Module_24_Reliability_29,129379,133099,on the accurate on to be accurate. 
Module_24_Reliability_30,133099,140159,"So, one can clearly say that reliability is about consistency, and a research would be "
Module_24_Reliability_31,140159,145700,"reliable if when repeated using the same method, it brings about the same results. "
Module_24_Reliability_32,145700,153049,"A researcher need to be, need to establish the usefulness of the data he or she gathered "
Module_24_Reliability_33,153049,159949,to ensure that whe… whether the conclusion reached are representative enough to be applicable 
Module_24_Reliability_34,159949,165569,to everyone and is it possible to repeat the research if others want to carry it out? 
Module_24_Reliability_35,165569,169620,"And if they do, will they get the similar results? "
Module_24_Reliability_36,169620,177239,So these questions can only be answered by researchers with the help of reliability and validity. 
Module_24_Reliability_37,177239,183790,"So reliability of data becomes important because if we do not have reliable data, the conclusion "
Module_24_Reliability_38,183790,187379,reached on their basis will be quite useless. 
Module_24_Reliability_39,187379,193169,"So, to have a better understanding of the concept of reliability, there are two things "
Module_24_Reliability_40,193169,194769,which we need to understand. 
Module_24_Reliability_41,194769,198120,They are consistency and precisions. 
Module_24_Reliability_42,198120,203389,"As it is important to obtain consistency, similar response to the same question in similar "
Module_24_Reliability_43,203389,210849,circumstances and one has to know how systematic is the form of data that is based on asking 
Module_24_Reliability_44,210849,215049,people questions about things that they know little about. 
Module_24_Reliability_45,215049,221739,"So, another typical feature which is very important with regard to reliability is repeatability. "
Module_24_Reliability_46,221739,228189,"That is, if anyone wants to carry out the same research as has been carried out by another "
Module_24_Reliability_47,228189,233239,"researcher, would he get the same results as the result of the researcher who carried "
Module_24_Reliability_48,233239,234760,out the research first? 
Module_24_Reliability_49,234760,240459,"If this happens, then the research of the first researcher would have repeatedly of "
Module_24_Reliability_50,240459,242930,the data collected method. 
Module_24_Reliability_51,242930,249619,"So, there are four general estimators that researcher may encounter. "
Module_24_Reliability_52,249619,256479,"One, observer reliability, that is the degree to which different observer gives consistent answer. "
Module_24_Reliability_53,256479,262930,"Second, test-retest reliability, the consistency of a measure evaluated over time. "
Module_24_Reliability_54,262930,269020,"Third, parallel-form reliability, the the reliability of two tests constructed the same "
Module_24_Reliability_55,269020,270980,way from the same content. 
Module_24_Reliability_56,270980,278389,"And finally, internal consistency reliability, the consistency of results across items, often "
Module_24_Reliability_57,278389,284310,"measured with Cronbach’s Alpha, a statistical tool used as an estimate of the reliability "
Module_24_Reliability_58,284310,286060,of a psychometric test. 
Module_24_Reliability_59,286060,291650,"So we will talk about the types of reliability, Kirk and Miller have discussed three types "
Module_24_Reliability_60,291650,296879,of reliability which will help a researcher to understand how reliable is his data. 
Module_24_Reliability_61,296879,303240,"So they are as follows- One, quixotic reliability, this refers to the circumstances in which "
Module_24_Reliability_62,303240,309330,a single method of observation yields the same measurement over and over again. 
Module_24_Reliability_63,309330,317289,"In other words, when a researcher ask questions, respondents respondents tend to give politically correct answers. "
Module_24_Reliability_64,317289,323610,"For example, if the subjects are asked questions like if they believe in giving equal rights "
Module_24_Reliability_65,323610,330449,"to their daughters in property, most of the respondents give response in affirmation but "
Module_24_Reliability_66,330449,332580,the reality is something else. 
Module_24_Reliability_67,332580,339539,This is called that the findings have only quixotic reliability because people tend to 
Module_24_Reliability_68,339539,342700,give those answers that they think are correct. 
Module_24_Reliability_69,342700,349560,"To get a correct view, one can ask the respondent if he would mind sharing his property with "
Module_24_Reliability_70,349560,356370,his sister or do you mind if your wife give away her rights in her parent’s property? 
Module_24_Reliability_71,356370,360259,Such questions can give a better and a clear picture. 
Module_24_Reliability_72,360259,364460,The second type of reliability is diachronic reliability. 
Module_24_Reliability_73,364460,368919,This refers to the stability of an observation over time. 
Module_24_Reliability_74,368919,375599,"Some examples include the test-retest paradigm of experimental psychology and survey research, "
Module_24_Reliability_75,375599,382530,in which survey are conducted afresh after a gap of time to see if the results are the same. 
Module_24_Reliability_76,382530,386469,"And then, the third part is called a synchronic reliability. "
Module_24_Reliability_77,386469,393240,"This refers to the similarities of observation withi… within the same time period, which "
Module_24_Reliability_78,393240,398599,can be evaluated by comparison of the same data by different methods. 
Module_24_Reliability_79,398599,406340,"Unlike quixotic reliability, synchronic reliability involves observation that are consistent in nature. "
Module_24_Reliability_80,406340,414050,"In the words of Kirk and Miller, synchronic reliability is often more useful if it is absent. "
Module_24_Reliability_81,414050,420300,"In other words, if different methods or approaches to a problem throw up different results, it "
Module_24_Reliability_82,420300,427590,"may caution the researcher to consider the other aspects of research, which he she has ignored earlier. "
Module_24_Reliability_83,427590,433340,A researcher should try to work towards increasing the reliability of data. 
Module_24_Reliability_84,433340,438509,He can achieve this by documenting his field notes so that they can be compared with the 
Module_24_Reliability_85,438509,441490,other field researcher and other colleagues. 
Module_24_Reliability_86,441490,448469,"Berman recommends extensive, explicit and perceptive field notes, self-analytical repo… "
Module_24_Reliability_87,448469,453979,"reporting of research procedure, and research context, documentation of the ethnographer’s "
Module_24_Reliability_88,453979,456800,theories of society and his biases. 
Module_24_Reliability_89,456800,464139,"To make your field notes accessible to others, certain guidelines must be followed that enables "
Module_24_Reliability_90,464139,470690,others to separate the concept of the observed from those of the observer. 
Module_24_Reliability_91,470690,476290,"So, the other method of achieving reliability can be by training the researcher before he "
Module_24_Reliability_92,476290,482469,or she enters the field and by checking his interview notes regularly and guiding him 
Module_24_Reliability_93,482469,484120,or her accordingly. 
Module_24_Reliability_94,484120,489430,This should be done immediately after the first interview so that correct measures are 
Module_24_Reliability_95,489430,490840,taken at the earliest. 
Module_24_Reliability_96,490840,498050,"Thus, we can say that reliability is achieved by presenting the data in such a way that "
Module_24_Reliability_97,498050,505850,"the results speak not only about the interpretation given by the researcher, but also the voice of the respondents. "
Module_24_Reliability_98,505850,513219,"Apart from the results, the procedure adopted by the researcher should also be taken into account. "
Module_24_Reliability_99,513219,515899,"Now, we have discussed about reliability. "
Module_24_Reliability_100,515899,521120,We come to the next topic which is very close to reliability is called validity. 
Module_24_Reliability_101,521120,523110,What is this Validity? 
Module_24_Reliability_102,523110,528910,Validity refers to the accuracy of the data generated by the research instrument like 
Module_24_Reliability_103,528910,534250,an interview schedule or questionnaire or some other means of research. 
Module_24_Reliability_104,534250,540130,Validity answers questions like whether the method adopted by the researcher affects the 
Module_24_Reliability_105,540130,545750,results of the factors that should have been considered but were ignored. 
Module_24_Reliability_106,545750,548540,These answers refer to the internal validity of a researcher. 
Module_24_Reliability_107,548540,557850,"Validity of a research is also about answering the question, how valid is one’s conception of the situation? "
Module_24_Reliability_108,557850,560760,How generalised are one’s results? 
Module_24_Reliability_109,560760,567490,"So, answer of these que… answer to these questions refer to the external validity of "
Module_24_Reliability_110,567490,574920,"your research, which can be explained as the generalised from the, from a sample to a population. "
Module_24_Reliability_111,574920,580110,Establishing external validity for an instrument then follows directly from sampling. 
Module_24_Reliability_112,580110,583311,There is also a face validity and the content validity. 
Module_24_Reliability_113,583311,588920,Face validity means stati… statistical measure of validity. 
Module_24_Reliability_114,588920,596750,"For example, type one error will will require rejection of the hypothesis when it is true "
Module_24_Reliability_115,596750,602029,and type two error will require acceptance of the hypothesis when it is false. 
Module_24_Reliability_116,602029,605019,This the concept of hypothesis is linked here. 
Module_24_Reliability_117,605019,609259,"So, if you have to understand the concept of hypothesis, you can go back to my module "
Module_24_Reliability_118,609259,612110,on hypothesis and discuss that validity part there. 
Module_24_Reliability_119,612110,620250,"So, content validity on the other hand refers to the appropriateness of the content of an instrument. "
Module_24_Reliability_120,620250,625910,"In other words, do the measure that is questions or observation logs, etcetera, accurately "
Module_24_Reliability_121,625910,628600,assess what you want to know? 
Module_24_Reliability_122,628600,631910,This is particularly important with the achievement test. 
Module_24_Reliability_123,631910,639120,Consider that a test developer wants to maximise the validity of a unit test for seventh grade mathematics. 
Module_24_Reliability_124,639120,644180,This would involve taking representa… representative questions from each of the sections of the 
Module_24_Reliability_125,644180,648519,unit and evaluating them against the desired outcomes. 
Module_24_Reliability_126,648519,652850,"So, that will be called as content validity. "
Module_24_Reliability_127,652850,658550,"It is easy to achieve validity in research as one has to keep in mind the adequate sampling, "
Module_24_Reliability_128,658550,665230,precision of observation and the subtle changes in environment and people are observed carefully. 
Module_24_Reliability_129,665230,671630,One can say that the concept of validity refers to the next extent to which the data provide 
Module_24_Reliability_130,671630,674730,a true measurement of social reality. 
Module_24_Reliability_131,674730,682779,Let us take an example from IGNOU material on research methodology of shortage of power supply. 
Module_24_Reliability_132,682779,687410,You may be quite sure of the statistics about power shortage week by week. 
Module_24_Reliability_133,687410,692940,You also have to be sure how valid or accurate a picture of power shortage in the whole town 
Module_24_Reliability_134,692940,697670,"or the state is, your static… statistics presence. "
Module_24_Reliability_135,697670,703600,"If you were to compare your figure with those collected by government agencies, its figure "
Module_24_Reliability_136,703600,708870,"may be re… reliable, but the government’s definition of power shortage may not be the "
Module_24_Reliability_137,708870,712199,same as is used in your research. 
Module_24_Reliability_138,712199,719209,"So and if this is the case, then the two set of statistics are not valid for the purpose "
Module_24_Reliability_139,719209,726760,"of comparison because the comparison is not between two things alike and therefore, research is not valid. "
Module_24_Reliability_140,726760,729670,How do we achieve validity in our research? 
Module_24_Reliability_141,729670,733850,So this is the question that we have to answer. 
Module_24_Reliability_142,733850,738970,"To bring about validity in the research process, Wolcott has suggested some guidelines. "
Module_24_Reliability_143,738970,741800,"They are, one should refrain from talking. "
Module_24_Reliability_144,741800,746230,"When you are in the field, listen as much as possible. "
Module_24_Reliability_145,746230,753019,"Secondly, produce field notes that are exact as as much as possible. "
Module_24_Reliability_146,753019,758390,Begin to write early so that you will not forget the little details that separate good 
Module_24_Reliability_147,758390,761230,research from the ordinary research. 
Module_24_Reliability_148,761230,767420,Write in such a way that your research can see for themselves the points you are trying to bring out. 
Module_24_Reliability_149,767420,774110,"In other words, provide enough data to enable readers to draw out their own inferences and "
Module_24_Reliability_150,774110,776440,follow the ones you are making. 
Module_24_Reliability_151,776440,780779,Your report should be as complete as possible. 
Module_24_Reliability_152,780779,785920,See feedback on your findings and presentation from your colleagues. 
Module_24_Reliability_153,785920,791329,Your presentation should be characterised by a balance between the various aspects you 
Module_24_Reliability_154,791329,797980,have studied rather than leaning too heavily on one or the other aspect. 
Module_24_Reliability_155,797980,801530,Your presentation should display accuracy in writing. 
Module_24_Reliability_156,801530,807220,"To check the validity of your research, one of the method is field research. "
Module_24_Reliability_157,807220,812850,"The very nature of field work is its flexibility and openness, which enables one to study the "
Module_24_Reliability_158,812850,815550,data in a variety of ways. 
Module_24_Reliability_159,815550,821339,"As in field situation, routine contact with people on day-to-day basis over an extended "
Module_24_Reliability_160,821339,827160,period of time will help the researcher to test the emerging hypothesis. 
Module_24_Reliability_161,827160,833889,This method is very sensitive to discrepancies between meaning presumed by investigations 
Module_24_Reliability_162,833889,837250,and those understood by the target population. 
Module_24_Reliability_163,837250,842220,So one has to clearly define his or her concept. 
Module_24_Reliability_164,842220,847139,Defining the concept is also very important for the researcher as the field is better 
Module_24_Reliability_165,847139,849389,known to respondent than to the researcher. 
Module_24_Reliability_166,849389,854100,"In a controlled experiment, the situation is other way around. "
Module_24_Reliability_167,854100,857590,But here the researcher has to work according to the respondent’s will. 
Module_24_Reliability_168,857590,866269,If the researcher is sincere and devoted to his field work and is receptive of the inputs 
Module_24_Reliability_169,866269,872510,"given by the respondents, then his or her research has greater chances of being valid. "
Module_24_Reliability_170,872510,879839,The validity can also be checked by taking respondents into the confidence and try try 
Module_24_Reliability_171,879839,883569,to involve them into research by the method of discussion. 
Module_24_Reliability_172,883569,891910,The researcher can share his or her data with the respondents and while discussing can ensure 
Module_24_Reliability_173,891910,899010,that there is no discrepancy in what the respondent said and what he or she has written. 
Module_24_Reliability_174,899010,905779,"This method of checking also has its own drawback, as sometimes respondents may deny of what "
Module_24_Reliability_175,905779,911260,the researcher has written as they might feel that it shows them in bad light. 
Module_24_Reliability_176,911260,918140,Here the role of the researcher becomes important as he or she has to differ… differentiate 
Module_24_Reliability_177,918140,923959,between the real responses and the released responses. 
Module_24_Reliability_178,923959,929389,"Lincoln and Guba in their book, Naturalistic Inquiry suggests that for checking the validity "
Module_24_Reliability_179,929389,935870,"of any data, a researcher should adopt few techniques while collecting the data and interacting "
Module_24_Reliability_180,935870,937129,with the respondent. 
Module_24_Reliability_181,937129,943120,"The researcher should spend more time in the field, which will help the researcher to understand "
Module_24_Reliability_182,943120,945770,his field and respondents better. 
Module_24_Reliability_183,945770,951079,Spending more time in the field will also help in the accuracy of the data as the researcher 
Module_24_Reliability_184,951079,957000,will be having a clear picture of the field and it is less likely that the respondent 
Module_24_Reliability_185,957000,960139,is able to deceive the researcher. 
Module_24_Reliability_186,960139,966269,"Now, when we have discussed the concept of reliability and validity, let us also understand "
Module_24_Reliability_187,966269,970139,try to understand the relationship these two concepts have. 
Module_24_Reliability_188,970139,976699,So reliability and validity are two different concepts that may or may not be related to one another. 
Module_24_Reliability_189,976699,980529,"Mostly, if data are valid, they must be reliable. "
Module_24_Reliability_190,980529,986230,"If people rec… receive very different scores on a test every time they take it, the test "
Module_24_Reliability_191,986230,988939,is not likely to be to predict anything. 
Module_24_Reliability_192,988939,993709,"However, a test can be considered reliable but not valid. "
Module_24_Reliability_193,993709,1001079,"For example, AILET or CLAT score can be used as a prediction of success in college. "
Module_24_Reliability_194,1001079,1008879,"It may be considered a reliable test, but only a moderately valid indicator of success. "
Module_24_Reliability_195,1008879,1015500,"Taking the same example of CLAT or AILET scores can, we can say that validity is more important "
Module_24_Reliability_196,1015500,1022810,"than reliability, as in college admission, AILET or CLAT score may be a reliable test, "
Module_24_Reliability_197,1022810,1030860,"but not necessarily valid measure of other qualitative qualities college seeks, for example, "
Module_24_Reliability_198,1030860,1035100,leadership participation in various academic and cultural activities. 
Module_24_Reliability_199,1035100,1040130,"So, we can say this is reliable but not a valid measurement. "
Module_24_Reliability_200,1040130,1046890,The combination of the these aspects alongside the AILET or CLAT score is more valid measure 
Module_24_Reliability_201,1046890,1054970,"of the applicant’s potential of, for graduation, later social involvement, and professional development. "
Module_24_Reliability_202,1054970,1060220,Last and the most important is the data should be both reliable as well as valid. 
Module_24_Reliability_203,1060220,1066920,Proponent of AILET and CLAT argue that it is both a reliable as well as valid test as 
Module_24_Reliability_204,1066920,1074540,"it measures student’s knowledge and aptitude, mathematics, language and reasoning. "
Module_24_Reliability_205,1074540,1080060,"So to understand the relationship between reliability and validity, we can conceptualise "
Module_24_Reliability_206,1080060,1089410,"them under four heads, that is Reliability and Validity, when the data is consistent "
Module_24_Reliability_207,1089410,1094860,"and also measures what it meant to measure, that is, a stable construct. "
Module_24_Reliability_208,1094860,1098830,"In that case, a data will be reliable as well as valid. "
Module_24_Reliability_209,1098830,1103190,"In the second condition, when the data is reliable that is, there is a consistency in "
Module_24_Reliability_210,1103190,1105440,the data but not valid. 
Module_24_Reliability_211,1105440,1112720,"That means, it measures something consistently but it does not measure what it is meant to measure. "
Module_24_Reliability_212,1112720,1120190,"Third, the data is unreliable, that it is not consistent, but and not valid. "
Module_24_Reliability_213,1120190,1126280,That is it is inconsistent measures which does not measure what it meant to measure. 
Module_24_Reliability_214,1126280,1134460,"Finally, data is unreliable that is it is not consistent and valid that it measures "
Module_24_Reliability_215,1134460,1136220,what it means to measure. 
Module_24_Reliability_216,1136220,1143660,"So, here unreliable data but it is measuring what it means to measure, that is, an unstable construct. "
Module_24_Reliability_217,1143660,1150080,A very important aspect with reliability and validity is how to measure the two. 
Module_24_Reliability_218,1150080,1156260,"So, while measuring reliability there are few methods that we have to keep in mind. "
Module_24_Reliability_219,1156260,1160290,One of them is stability or test-retest method. 
Module_24_Reliability_220,1160290,1166010,"That means, it gives the same assessment twice separated by days, weeks or months. "
Module_24_Reliability_221,1166010,1172720,Reliability is stated as the correlation between scores at time one and time two. 
Module_24_Reliability_222,1172720,1175680,And this is how we can measure the reliability. 
Module_24_Reliability_223,1175680,1180250,The other way of measuring reliability is alternate form. 
Module_24_Reliability_224,1180250,1185010,It creates two forms of the same tests that vary the items slightly. 
Module_24_Reliability_225,1185010,1192400,Reliability is stated as correlation between score of test one and test two. 
Module_24_Reliability_226,1192400,1196760,The last way of measuring reliability is the internal consistency method. 
Module_24_Reliability_227,1196760,1200180,This is also known as Alpha method. 
Module_24_Reliability_228,1200180,1206000,It compares one half of the test to the other half or use methods such as Kuder-Richardson 
Module_24_Reliability_229,1206000,1211240,"Formula twenty, that is KR twenty or Cronbach’s Alpha. "
Module_24_Reliability_230,1211240,1215950,The value for reliability coefficient range from zero to one. 
Module_24_Reliability_231,1215950,1221150,A coefficient of zero means no reliability and one means perfect reliability. 
Module_24_Reliability_232,1221150,1227060,"Since all tests have some error, reliability coefficient never reaches one. "
Module_24_Reliability_233,1227060,1231870,"Generally, if the reliability of a standardised test is above point zero eight, it is said "
Module_24_Reliability_234,1231870,1234910,to have very good reliability. 
Module_24_Reliability_235,1234910,1240090,"If it is below point five zero, it would not be considered a reliable test. "
Module_24_Reliability_236,1240090,1246600,"As we have measured reliability, there is a method of measuring validity as well. "
Module_24_Reliability_237,1246600,1255190,Validity refers to the accuracy of an assessment whether or not it measures what it is supposed to measure. 
Module_24_Reliability_238,1255190,1259880,"Even if a test is reliable, it may not provide a valid measure. "
Module_24_Reliability_239,1259880,1266080,Let us imagine a bathroom scale that consistently tells you that you weigh one thirty pounds. 
Module_24_Reliability_240,1266080,1271740,"Reliability of the scale is very good, but it is not accurate because you actually weigh "
Module_24_Reliability_241,1271740,1277210,one forty five pound and you reset the scale in a weak moment. 
Module_24_Reliability_242,1277210,1283120,"Some teachers, parents and school districts make decision about students based on assessments "
Module_24_Reliability_243,1283120,1286200,"such as grades, promotion and graduation. "
Module_24_Reliability_244,1286200,1292750,"The validity inferred from the assessment is essential, even more crucial than the reliability. "
Module_24_Reliability_245,1292750,1297430,"Also, if a test is valid, it is almost always reliable. "
Module_24_Reliability_246,1297430,1303160,There are three ways in which validity can be measured in order to have confidence that 
Module_24_Reliability_247,1303160,1309000,a test is valid and therefore the inference we make based on the test scores are valid. 
Module_24_Reliability_248,1309000,1312340,All three kinds of validity evidence should be considered. 
Module_24_Reliability_249,1312340,1314970,To measure a content validity. 
Module_24_Reliability_250,1314970,1316420,What is the content validity? 
Module_24_Reliability_251,1316420,1322940,The extent to which the content of the test matches the instructional objective. 
Module_24_Reliability_252,1322940,1328340,Example for this would be a semester or a quarter exam that only includes content converted 
Module_24_Reliability_253,1328340,1334300,during the last six weeks is not a valid measure of the course’s overall objective. 
Module_24_Reliability_254,1334300,1337900,It has a very low content validity. 
Module_24_Reliability_255,1337900,1342510," Criteria validity, it means the extent to which scores on the test are in "
Module_24_Reliability_256,1342510,1349610,"agreement with concurrent validity or predict that is, predictive validity and external criteria . "
Module_24_Reliability_257,1349610,1354720,If the end of the year math test in fourth grade correlate highly with the statewide 
Module_24_Reliability_258,1354720,1358480,"math test, they would have high concurrent validity. "
Module_24_Reliability_259,1358480,1364910,Construct validity is the extent to which an assessment correspond to other variables 
Module_24_Reliability_260,1364910,1368670,as predicted by some rational or theory. 
Module_24_Reliability_261,1368670,1374720,If you can correctly hypothesize and ESOL students will perform differently on a reading 
Module_24_Reliability_262,1374720,1381990,"test than English speaking student, because of theory, the assessment may have construct validity. "
Module_24_Reliability_263,1381990,1387660,This is how you can measure the validity and reliability of any test. 
Module_24_Reliability_264,1387660,1391770,Reliability and Validity are two important concepts for any research. 
Module_24_Reliability_265,1391770,1396740,And it is important for the researcher to understand the relationship as well as the 
Module_24_Reliability_266,1396740,1398710,distinction between the two. 
Module_24_Reliability_267,1398710,1405720,It helps a researcher to have a better understanding of his or her results and make his or her 
Module_24_Reliability_268,1405720,1407130,research more authentic. 
Module_24_Reliability_269,1407130,1410210,Reliability and validity are independent of each other. 
Module_24_Reliability_270,1410210,1416730,"A measurement may be valid, but not reliable or reliable, but not valid. "
Module_24_Reliability_271,1416730,1422410,"So, both qualitative as quantitative research requires reliability and validity. "
Module_24_Reliability_272,1422410,1431050,"Thus a researcher should keep in mind that for a research data to be use and value, it "
Module_24_Reliability_273,1431050,1434800,should be both reliable as well as valid. 
Module_24_Reliability_274,1434800,1440290,So this gives us a concluding remark on reliability and validity. 
Module_24_Reliability_275,1440290,1445690,Hope this discussion is useful for you in conducting your research. 
Module_24_Reliability_276,1445690,1449770,"And in case you have any queries, you can always email me or you have questions you "
Module_24_Reliability_277,1449770,1450770,can always post it to me. 
Module_24_Reliability_278,1450770,1451160,Thank you so much.

Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_7,73670,79250,To encapsulate the methods of conducting doctrinal and qualitative research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_8,79250,87580,To discuss the broad aims and objectives of qualitative and doctrinal methods of research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_9,87580,93580,It abso… it also helps you to comprehend the advantages and limitations of qualitative 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_10,93580,96910,and doctrinal method of research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_11,96910,102800,To also help you understand the distinguishing factors between qualitative and doctrinal 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_12,102800,106250,method of research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_13,106250,116940,"In this module, we shall discuss the following areas, contemporary discussion on qualitative "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_14,116940,120910,and doctrinal methods of conducting research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_15,120910,123830,What is doctrinal legal research? 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_16,123830,126570,Doctrinal method. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_17,126570,129090,What is qualitative research? 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_18,129090,137330,Common elements in every qualitative research and the distinguishing factors.

Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_20,142930,147430,Basic tools of qualitative and doctrinal research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_21,147430,155470,"Advantages and limitations of qualitative and doctrinal methods of research and finally, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_22,155470,159280,the summary of what we have learned so far. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_23,159280,165220,A brief short a brief short introduction to qualitative or doctrinal research debate 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_24,165220,172070,would be fit to locate both of them and analyse them with respect to their positives and shortcomings. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_25,172070,179900,Bryman had identified some eleven ways to integrate these two types of researches. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_26,179900,186330,"According to Bryman, the logic of triangulation means to check, for examples of qualitative "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_27,186330,189610,against doctrinal research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_28,189610,196000,The qualitative research outcome can support doctrinal method and vice-versa. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_29,196000,202930,Both are combined in to provide a more general pictures of the issue under study. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_30,202930,211760,Structural features are analysed with doctrinal methods and processual aspects with qualitative approaches. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_31,211760,216900,"The perspective of the researcher derives the quantitative approaches, while qualitative "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_32,216900,221560,research emphasises the viewpoint of the subjective. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_33,221560,228770,"According to Bryman, the problem of generality can be solved for qualitative research by "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_34,228770,235380,"adding doctrinal findings, whereas qualitative findings may facilitate the interpretation "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_35,235380,240630,of relationship between variables in datasets. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_36,240630,246490,The relationship between micro and macro levels in a substantial area can be clarified by 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_37,246490,254220,combining the two researches which can be appropriate in different stages of the research process. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_38,254220,263190,"Finally, there are hybrid forms that use qualitative research and quasi experimental designs. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_39,263190,270979,"The doctrinal legal research can be defined as research into legal doctrines, through "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_40,270979,276530,analysis of a statutory provisions and cases by the application of reasoning. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_41,276530,284810,"The emphasis upon analysis of legal rules, principles or doctrines as compared to non-doctrinal "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_42,284810,292550,"legal research, which aims at research on relationship of law with society, groups, and people. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_43,292550,299720,"It involves an empirical inquiry into the operation of law, how the doctrine or principle "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_44,299720,303010,which has been adopted in real-world settings. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_45,303010,310139,"Thus, the doctrinal legal research emphasise upon research in law focusing. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_46,310139,316740,"Thus, the doctrinal legal research emphasise upon the research in law, force focusing on "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_47,316740,319220,the black letters of the law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_48,319220,323150,The non-doctrinal research focuses on research about law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_49,323150,327810,Here the researcher is interested in knowing about the law inaction. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_50,327810,333810,"The former can be understood as amateur research, or basic or fundamental research, the latter "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_51,333810,339680,is empirical research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_52,339680,348960,"It begins, the doctrinal method begins by taking up a proposition as a starting point of focus. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_53,348960,355280,"He then locates the law and statutes, judicial pronouncements and discussions and commentaries, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_54,355280,359200,"textbooks, journals and debates. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_55,359200,364950,"Reads them in a holistic manner, analyse them and write his findings. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_56,364950,370010,"For example, a research on proposition of prevention against double jeopardy under criminal "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_57,370010,376960,law would begin with locating the law in constitution and criminal law materials. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_58,376960,383060,"On the basis of the analysis of the same, the researcher may advance the set of formulations "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_59,383060,389460,or may also highlight the objective behind the proposition and may propose what it ought to be. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_60,389460,398210,"On the other hand, qualitative research developed as an alternative to quantitative research, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_61,398210,403400,it has grown from simply not being quantitative research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_62,403400,409030,"It has gained multiple dimensions now, which can be understood from the general understanding "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_63,409030,418479,"that this research focuses at the real-world in order to understand, describe, and explain "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_64,418479,423620,social phenomena from the inside in multiple ways. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_65,423620,432020,"It is done by analyzing experiences of individuals or groups, by analysing directions and communications "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_66,432020,434510,or by analysing documents. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_67,434510,441920,"However, the common element is that it seeks to identify how people view the world, what "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_68,441920,451130,they are doing or what is happening to them in terms which are meaningful and offer rich insights. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_69,451130,454990,There are certain common elements in every qualitative research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_70,454990,463840,"They are that every qualitative research is it methodological, theoretical, epistemological, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_71,463840,469070,"has certain common elements, which can be broadly identified as below. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_72,469070,477830,"Experiences, interactions, and documents are analysed in the natural context. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_73,477830,483960,Concepts and hypothesis are developed and refined in the process of research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_74,483960,490340,It is starts from the idea that theory and method should be appropriate to what is studied. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_75,490340,494479,They can be adapted if they do not fit in. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_76,494479,499130,"Researchers themselves are also an important part of the research process, either due to "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_77,499130,504759,their own personal experiences or research experiences. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_78,504759,507780,It takes cases and context seriously. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_79,507780,515389,"A major part is dependent on text and documents, thus issues of transcribing complex social "

Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_90,574749,581600,There are certain distinguishing factors between qualitative and doctrinal methods. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_91,581600,586980,"The qualitative legal research is different from doctrinal legal search on many grounds, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_92,586980,594730,"some of them are – It lays down a different emphasis upon legal doctrines and concepts, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_93,594730,601329,while the emphasis of doctrinal is purely basic and fundamental in exposing the law as it exists. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_94,601329,606430,The latter look it from the perspective of social reality. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_95,606430,611790,Qualitative research seeks to answer broader issues as clear from the aims and objectives 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_96,611790,614579,as would be discussed below. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_97,614579,620519,The doctrinal research has a focus on a particular point of law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_98,620519,625870,"It does not focuses exclusively on case reports, and other traditional primary and secondary "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_99,625870,628000,legal documents for analysis. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_100,628000,633970,"However, it is dependent on doctrinal methods in the sense that without a thorough grasp "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_101,633970,639439,"on fundamentals, the qualitative researcher would not be able to chart his voyage in a "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_102,639439,641899,meaningful manner. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_103,641899,647779,"It takes a different route for research wis… which has in focus to analyse law in action, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_104,647779,650619,as distinguished from law in books. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_105,650619,654930,The qualitative and doctrinal methods have different aim objectives. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_106,654930,660079,"While the former is about finding, analysing the legal concepts and doctrines like for "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_107,660079,664079,"example, the principle of a strict liability under law of torts. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_108,664079,670790,"The latter is concerned with law in action, that is, as to analyse the legal idealism "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_109,670790,674040,from the lens of social reality. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_110,674040,683829,Each has its own utility and uniqueness and are interdependent on each other. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_111,683829,691480,To discuss the aims and objectives of doctrinal research – Doctrinal research helps to find 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_112,691480,699100,"the law in the legal statutes, subordinates legislations and judicial precedents. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_113,699100,707319,"It aims at consistency and certainty of law, to some extent it looks into the purpose and "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_114,707319,711239,policy of law that exists. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_115,711239,717480,"Doctrinal research also aims to study legal institutions like courts, police machinery, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_116,717480,720189,"jail, tribunals, etcetera. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_117,720189,724410,Discussing the aims and objectives of qualitative research – A qualitative research focuses 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_118,724410,727600,on the social facets of the law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_119,727600,733720,"Its primary aim is to determine through empirical data, how law and legal institutions affect "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_120,733720,739059,or mould human attitudes and what is their impact on the society they create. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_121,739059,744480,"The researcher primary looks into, How far the law and legal institutions are serving "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_122,744480,745759,the needs of the society? 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_123,745759,751660,Are they suited in the social context in which they operate? 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_124,751660,758389,It determines the forces that shape reshapes and mould the law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_125,758389,765589,It is helpful in analysing how far the law has been enforced and administered. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_126,765589,772490,It discusses the causes for the factors responsible for the poor performance of the law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_127,772490,778209,It also look into the factors which moulds the enforcement machinery attitudes and behaviour 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_128,778209,782370,while interpreting enforcing the law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_129,782370,787579,Are beneficiaries under the law using it or the law is merely symbolic? 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_130,787579,793079,Whether the targeted beneficiaries are benefiting out of the law? 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_131,793079,799500,"If the law is failing to help people, where does the problem lie? "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_132,799500,804869,"Impact of law on behaviour and attitude of society, people in groups are also determined "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_133,804869,809389,by this method. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_134,809389,813480,Every research has its own specific tools and methods. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_135,813480,820680,Research instruments are the tools in the hands of the researcher to conduct the research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_136,820680,825660,Proper tools ensure a well-planned and systematic inquiry. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_137,825660,831709,The researcher shall aim at developing procedures which are reliable and valid. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_138,831709,837290,"By being reliable it is meant that there is consistency of a measure, while being valid "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_139,837290,842139,means to which the measure achieves it aims. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_140,842139,846579,They can be classified into primary and secondary sources. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_141,846579,850980,Let us have a look into the tools of these two types of researchers. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_142,850980,858209,"First, we shall discuss the basic tools of qualitative research. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_143,858209,862970,There are several ways of collecting data for qualitative research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_144,862970,871269,"The primary sources are interview, questionnaire, schedule, interview guide and observation. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_145,871269,877459,It can be collected from either posing selected respondents to a set of predetermined questions 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_146,877459,879160,or sketchy questions. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_147,879160,886199,It involves a face-to-face conversation and this tool of data collection is known as interviewing. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_148,886199,893540,"The predetermined questions can also be mailed, send by post, fax, or other ways in order "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_149,893540,898870,to gather responses from selected respondents. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_150,898870,905429,This tool of data collection is known as data collection by way of questionnaires. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_151,905429,910429,The researcher can also collect data by the method of observation. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_152,910429,920509,"A systematic observation of a phenomenon, behaviour of participants, respondents or institutions. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_153,920509,927769,"The secondary sources are the published or unpublished reports, for example, crime reports. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_154,927769,934069,"The secondary sources are the published or unpublished reports, for example, crime records, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_155,934069,937259,"report of international organisation, etcetera. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_156,937259,944129,"A general understanding of tools like interview, questionnaire, schedule, interview guide and "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_157,944129,948579,observation would be useful. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_158,948579,952379,Interview is a verbal technique of data collection. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_159,952379,956079,It may be structured or unstructured. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_160,956079,961860,It is a structured when the researcher uses a set of predetermined questions and highly 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_161,961860,965919,standardised technique of recording the responses. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_162,965919,971790,It is unstructured when there is flexibility in the approach to the questioning and much 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_163,971790,974649,lesser standardisation. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_164,974649,980810,It is unstructured when there is flexibility in the approach to the questioning and much 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_165,980810,985660,lesser standardised way of recording the responses. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_166,985660,990350,The strength of this tool is that it remains to be the most effective method of gaining 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_167,990350,996069,information about respondent’s perception and opinions. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_168,996069,1002259,It also enables the researcher to authenticate the information coming from the respondents 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_169,1002259,1006000,by observing the body language or respondent. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_170,1006000,1010720,"However, administering and interview is an art. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_171,1010720,1016149,One needs to have the one needs to have the required skillset in order to conduct 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_172,1016149,1018549,a meaningful interview. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_173,1018549,1026120,"Undoubtedly being most effective, it has its limitations, like memory bias, inability of "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_174,1026120,1032799,the respondents to provide every information asked for and bias. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_175,1032799,1039480,"Questionnaire – In questionnaire, a number of typed or printed predetermined questions "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_176,1039480,1044360,"are used for collecting data, it is sent to the respondents with the request to send it "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_177,1044360,1050080,back to the researcher after filing the responses. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_178,1050080,1053980,It may also be structured or unstructured. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_179,1053980,1060930,"The questions may be open-ended, close-ended, mixed or pictorial. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_180,1060930,1068050,The method can be very effective in circumstances where the respondents are scattered in a vast area. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_181,1068050,1069050,It is queaper… 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_182,1069050,1073280,It is quicker and cheaper as compared to interviews. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_183,1073280,1078110,Schedule is more or less same as the questionnaire. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_184,1078110,1082770,But the major differences are that schedule is referred to form filled in by the 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_185,1082770,1088980,"interviewer during his personal interview with the respondents and questionnaire, being "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_186,1088980,1091320,impersonal is rigid. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_187,1091320,1096240,"The schedule is flexible, because it gives the opportunity to the researcher to calify… "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_188,1096240,1102850,"the, to clarify the questions, if they are not clear to the respondents. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_189,1102850,1109540,Interview guide – It contains only the topics of broad headings upon which the respondents 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_190,1109540,1111580,are asked to answer. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_191,1111580,1120040,"Usually, the questions are formulated on the spot and the responses are thereby recorded. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_192,1120040,1124020,Observation is a visual method of data collection. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_193,1124020,1129940,"It is another specific way of data collection, it is another scientific way of data collection "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_194,1129940,1135750,when planned in a systematic manner and recorded systematically and is subject to check and 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_195,1135750,1142430,control on validity and reliability. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_196,1142430,1149781,"There are certain basic tools of doctrinal research, statutory materials, subordinate "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_197,1149781,1154750,"legal materials, and case laws constitute the primary sources. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_198,1154750,1163450,"While the secondary sources the researcher refers to are the textbooks, legal articles, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_199,1163450,1165680,"parliamentary debates, etcetera. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_200,1165680,1172310,"For example, if someone has to undertake a study on the principles of compulsory licencing "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_201,1172310,1178700,"under the law of patents, then the relevant provisions of the Patents Act nineteen seventy "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_202,1178700,1184770,"international instruments pertaining to compulsory licencing, law on compulsory licencing in "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_203,1184770,1192140,"different jurisdictions, findings of the court and intellectual property appellate board "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_204,1192140,1199580,"like in the Matter of Application for Compulsory Licence by Natco corporation income advisor, one "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_205,1199580,1203070,constitutes primary sources. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_206,1203070,1209280,"While the commentaries on the provision pertain to compulsory licence, in a standard textbooks, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_207,1209280,1217810,"commentaries, articles and law journals, news reports, blogs, etcetera, would constitute second resources.    "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_208,1217810,1224230,"So, what are the advantages of doctrinal method?  "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_209,1224230,1229570,Doctrinal method provides quick answers to the practical problem at hand by analysing 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_210,1229570,1236190,"the legal principles, concepts and doctrines, thereby serving as a ready reference to people "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_211,1236190,1243390,who didn’t have a time at the disposal to understand that research by themselves. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_212,1243390,1249000,"Because comparatively speaking, a doctrinal research requires less time. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_213,1249000,1256970,"So thereby, it ensures the constant stream of information on a regular basis. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_214,1256970,1265900,"Doctrinal method gives insights into the evolution and development of the law, for example, consumer protection law. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_215,1265900,1273310,It offers a logical explanation to the law and at the same time also highlights inconsistencies 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_216,1273310,1277450,and uncertainties in the law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_217,1277450,1283080,"It reveals gaps, ambiguities, and inconsistencies in the law. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_218,1283080,1289690,"Thus, informs us as to how law can be more purposive and effective. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_219,1289690,1296550,It lay down a roadmap to develop the law for avoiding the pitfalls. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_220,1296550,1300480,It helps in increasing the legal knowledge base. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_221,1300480,1308620,Future direction of the law can be predicted on the basis of such studies. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_222,1308620,1314820,"It provides a sound basis of non-doctrinal research, because in deficit of the required "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_223,1314820,1320570,"preliminary knowledge, the venture of non-doctrinal research would be directionless and therefore "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_224,1320570,1327640,"futile, but there are certain limitations of doctrinal method. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_225,1327640,1332950,The first limitation is that it can be subjective and suffer from the voice of perception of 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_226,1332950,1336560,the researcher about the required subject matter. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_227,1336560,1343560,"Therefore, another person can reach upon an entirely different dimension to the same question. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_228,1343560,1348880,"Further, it is devoid of any support from social facts. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_229,1348880,1352680,"Therefore, his projection might be far off the social reality. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_230,1352680,1361740,"This is a serious concern, as law can act as an instrument of social transformation. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_231,1361740,1367620,"It neglects the factors that lie outside the strict brackets of law, which might have a "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_232,1367620,1371840,"bearing upon the legal principle, theory or doctrine. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_233,1371840,1377450,"For example, the recent amendment in the criminal law regarding rape, were in a huge public "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_234,1377450,1382380,outcry was a extra legal factor that shaped the law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_235,1382380,1387840,The actual practice and attitudes of people who are the functionaries and those who implement 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_236,1387840,1389160,the law is also not taken into account. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_237,1389160,1394650,"For example, the attitude of judges, lawyers, police,   "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_238,1394650,1395650,"administrative authorities, courts  "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_239,1395650,1404190,"and tribunals, etcetera.The qualitative research has following merits. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_240,1404190,1409320,It highlights the gaps between goals and social reality. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_241,1409320,1414140,It depicts a true picture of law in action. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_242,1414140,1421390,"It highlights the gaps in relation to practice of law, enforcement agencies and as well as "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_243,1421390,1428400,in the use and underuse of the law by the beneficiaries of the law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_244,1428400,1434890,It highlights the reasons behind failure of a law in real-world. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_245,1434890,1441490,It may be inactiveness or lack of willingness on the part of those entrusted with the task 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_246,1441490,1449730,of enforcing the law or maybe resistance on the part of intended beneficiaries for multifarious 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_247,1449730,1459870,"reasons like unawareness, fear of further victimisation, huge costs in the terms of "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_248,1459870,1461790,time and money. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_249,1461790,1468880,It thus exposes the weakness in the operation of law. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_250,1468880,1476960,In the modern welfare state law acts as a tool of social and economic transformation. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_251,1476960,1483590,The qualitative research can bring forward the role and contribution of law in bringing 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_252,1483590,1487340,about desired changes. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_253,1487340,1495210,It also can highlight the gaps that have been left in the law and social reality so that 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_254,1495210,1501190,law can be reassessed in the light of new information. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_255,1501190,1509770,"It serves as a significant resource in the form of a social feedback to policy framers, "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_256,1509770,1520970,"legislators and judiciary so that they can better enforce, legislate and interpret the law. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_257,1520970,1530800,It shapes social legislations in tune with the social enduring doctrine of the modern state. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_258,1530800,1537890,But there are certain limitations of qualitative research also. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_259,1537890,1544800,Qualitative research is extremely time consuming and also very costly. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_260,1544800,1553040,The researcher in this research has to build upon the bedrock of doctrinal research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_261,1553040,1562650,"He must be true with the doctrines and concepts, otherwise his research and endeavour would be futile. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_262,1562650,1570130,"The primary tools of data collection, namely interviews, questionnaires and observation "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_263,1570130,1577970,requires a specialised skill set right from the stage of planning to the execution. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_264,1577970,1585680,"Now, let us recapitulate what we have learned so far. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_265,1585680,1593200,"From the above analysis, it can be understood that qualitative research arose primarily "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_266,1593200,1597030,as a critique of doctrinal research. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_267,1597030,1603670,It was felt that the research outcomes were inadequate and incomplete in absence of an 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_268,1603670,1607560,analysis done in real-world settings. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_269,1607560,1614670,"Nevertheless, both research methods had their own merits and shortcomings. "
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_270,1614670,1622880,But it can safely be concluded that both informs the law and policy and are interdependent on each other. 
Module_8_Qualitative_&_Doctrinal_Methods_in_Research_271,1622880,1624140,Thank you.  
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_0,32829,37940,"Hello friends, I am Doctor Himanshu Pandey, Assistant Professor, School of law, Devi Ahilya "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_1,37940,39620,"Vishwa Vidyalaya, Indore. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_2,39620,47329,"Today, I am going to deliver my lecture on this present module basics of research. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_3,47329,54440,This module contain an easy and layman approach for understanding research and its fundamental 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_4,54440,61769,"aspects, concerning objectives, purposes and importance of research. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_5,61769,68850,How research methods vary from one stream of knowledge to other especially questions 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_6,68850,73060,relating to the nature and objectives of legal research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_7,73060,79899,"All these points have been dealt under this module, which will be explained by this lecture. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_8,79899,88420,Objective of this lecture and module is to develop basic understanding of research and 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_9,88420,91720,their relationship with human being. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_10,91720,98690,"Human development is the outcome of research process and identifying research process, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_11,98690,100229,its kind and importance. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_12,100229,109300,"To develop skills to design, analyze and research on socio-legal problems, so that you can plan "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_13,109300,115580,and pursue legal and socio-legal research in your future. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_14,115580,121739,"For understanding the concept of research, it is necessary to understand this concept "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_15,121739,122970,in two ways. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_16,122970,127800,"First, in its ordinary sense and second one is technical sense. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_17,127800,135150,"Before coming to technical sense, it is necessary to understand the concept in practical lives. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_18,135150,143370,"Examples, in ordinary sense the person used to solve his problem of life in his day to "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_19,143370,146500,day action. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_20,146500,153420,Such action performed by the person towards his problem-solving is sometimes ordinarily 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_21,153420,164280,"called as research in fact, that is not right to say research in technical term. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_22,164280,172010,"If a man perceives any problem, any fact, any phenomena, or any transaction problematic "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_23,172010,179590,"in his life and he has no experience and knowledge how to handle that problem, immediately this "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_24,179590,187900,is the natural phenomena or natural quality of the man that immediately he moves to search 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_25,187900,190319,the knowledge. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_26,190319,197870,"He moves to search the knowledge towards problem-solving with experts, experienced person, and credible "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_27,197870,206180,persons supposed to have the answer of such problem or knowledge to resolve that problem. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_28,206180,210560,"After applying seeking that knowledge, he applies that knowledge and try to resolve "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_29,210560,213220,his problem way of life. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_30,213220,219260,"Whether his problem will be solved or not, it depends. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_31,219260,227819,This process of problem solving in the life is an problem solving action and that problem 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_32,227819,238989,solving action is not scientific because the method used to find out the solution of the 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_33,238989,245880,problem has not proceeded according to the scientific methods and it was not acted in 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_34,245880,248459,a systematic manner. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_35,248459,255879,This whole process may be called as non-research action and non-research action is always other 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_36,255879,260269,"than the research, which is not amount to research. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_37,260269,266819,There is a difference between non-research action and research process. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_38,266819,275280,"The non-research action is allfay… always complex in its process, and if any action "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_39,275280,281160,"not performed systematically, obviously its result would not be reliable. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_40,281160,288600,"If the results are not reliable, and applying those results in, to satisfy any problem of "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_41,288600,296849,"life, maybe risky affair or may be harmful for the person or the society or institution. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_42,296849,304979,"On the contrarily, research process is a scientific process of searching knowledge. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_43,304979,308979,Scientific process of searching knowledge means all those methods which have already 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_44,308979,315219,been approved are used for pursuing research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_45,315219,322601,"Though those models suggested for pursuing research are not conclusive, the researcher "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_46,322601,331449,has his choice to modify and take any method according to his purpose and objectives of 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_47,331449,333050,research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_48,333050,342599,"And any such data which has been obtained by pursuing the scientific process, its results "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_49,342599,346869,can be relied and valid. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_50,346869,356120,"And any such reliable and valid conclusion can be used in the stock of knowledge, can "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_51,356120,362199,contribute towards the existing stock of knowledge. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_52,362199,369139,After dis… discussing about the concept in its ordinary way. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_53,369139,375690,"Now, it is necessary to understand the concept with its technical sense. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_54,375690,384940,"In technical sense, we can say that research is the composition of two terms, one is re "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_55,384940,386710,and second one is search. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_56,386710,395830,"Re is the Latin term means again, afresh and repeated investigation. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_57,395830,400990,Search means to find out something by looking or otherwise seeking. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_58,400990,408559,"Here these two terms are itself suggesting the whole process, means to find out something "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_59,408559,417300,"by directly observing the phenomena or by any other sources or methods, this is the "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_60,417300,418340,research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_61,418340,428710,"Here the research is a process that process starts from selection of research problem, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_62,428710,435789,after selec… selecting any research problem researcher moves to solve that problem. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_63,435789,443690,His movement for solving the problem comes with his second step that is the study of 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_64,443690,445509,facts. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_65,445509,454279,He try to gather all such relevant information facts relating to his problem and after analyzing 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_66,454279,463179,"those facts, he comes on certain conclusion and after concluding that thing he find any "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_67,463179,465360,knowledge. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_68,465360,473889,"And if that knowledge is applied for the utility, for the benefit of the society and if that "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_69,473889,482949,"knowledge can satisfy or cope up the society from that problem, now it can be called as "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_70,482949,485469,a success process of research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_71,485469,492939,"The research process includes some major questions like what, what to search? "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_72,492939,493939,Why to search? 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_73,493939,496360,"And, how to search? "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_74,496360,501250,The term ‘what’ it denotes the object of research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_75,501250,511119,‘Why’ denoting the purposes thereof and third ‘how’ stands for the methods used 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_76,511119,515000,for the research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_77,515000,525290,"Major components of research are, its objective, second is purpose and third one is method "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_78,525290,532140,"used for data collection, data analysis and interpretation thereof. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_79,532140,540209,It is necessary to make it clear and distinguish between two terms which are usually and repeatedly 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_80,540209,547450,used with every research that is the objectives of research and purpose of research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_81,547450,552200,Objective of research and purpose of research are not the same. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_82,552200,557560,Objectives have different working and purposes have different results. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_83,557560,567740,"Objectives of any research is to seek the knowledge by describing the nature of research, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_84,567740,574460,quality of research or philosophy or the principle of research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_85,574460,582990,"And purpose, part of the research always denotes that how that re.. result of the research "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_86,582990,586070,will be beneficial for the society. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_87,586070,595380,"Who would be the beneficiary of the res… results, how that research conclusion, research "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_88,595380,604210,"results will be beneficial for them or it can the rationale of the research which is, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_89,604210,608180,comes within the part of purpose of research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_90,608180,614470,"Object and purpose are somewhere relating terms, are not independent having nectious "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_91,614470,616810,with each other. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_92,616810,625580,This relation of the object and purpose of research have been shown by one example and 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_93,625580,634490,"in this example, they are three persons, mister A, mister B and mister C. Object of all these "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_94,634490,643450,"three are the same, that is the construction of residential house property. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_95,643450,650430,"Object of A, B and C are the same, whereas they have their individual purpose. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_96,650430,656191,"Mister A wants to construct house property for his own residential use, whereas mister "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_97,656191,664150,"B wants to construct house property for letting it out, and mister C wants to make his inves, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_98,664150,668890,capital investment by this object. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_99,668890,675280,"That means, we can better understand that there is a relation between objective of research "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_100,675280,678690,and purpose of research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_101,678690,685080,"Any research topic undertaken by the researcher at the same time, at different times may have "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_102,685080,692520,"the same topic, selected the same obj, with same objectives, but their individual purposes "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_103,692520,697250,of research may be different. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_104,697250,709960,Some researcher wants to research to find out the real research problem of the life. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_105,709960,722280,Other wants to research for getting any academic degree like doctorate and third other researcher 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_106,722280,726940,he may be interested to work for any funding agencies. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_107,726940,734570,Here the object of research is the same but the purposes of the research may different 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_108,734570,738940,"from the time, space and objectives of individual researcher. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_109,738940,745660,"On the basis of different objectives, the research can be classified as inventive research, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_110,745660,752630,"exploratory research, explanatory research, diagnostic research, remedial research, comparative "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_111,752630,758860,"research, experimental research and at last historical research. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_112,758860,766280,"All these explanations, classifications of research are illustrative one or not conclusive. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_113,766280,776510,There may be some other kinds of classification on the basis of different objectives and dimensions. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_114,776510,785540,"The first category or what we can say, the first kind of research on the basis of its "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_115,785540,791650,objective to invent something that is called inventive research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_116,791650,793010,inta… 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_117,793010,802880,Inventive research is the process by which the researcher wants to search any theory 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_118,802880,812920,"or principle and by propounding that theory, he can innovate any noble product. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_119,812920,823540,"Inventive research is usually applied for material things, any such invention which "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_120,823540,826970,is not existed earlier. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_121,826970,831510,This method is based on the pure science and personal skills of the researcher. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_122,831510,841900,"First researcher try to find out some facts, methods, methodology on the basis of his logical "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_123,841900,844290,analysis. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_124,844290,852240,"And any such knowledge which is not exist earlier, he try to collect that knowledge "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_125,852240,859840,at the primary stage and on the basis of that knowledge he develop or built his theory. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_126,859840,866630,"And by that, by applying that theory he innovates any material product or thing. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_127,866630,875040,"Example of inventive research is articles, instruments, machineries or devices. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_128,875040,881100,"After inventive research, the second research that is the exploratory research. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_129,881100,890290,"Object of exploratory resea… research is to explore any unknown fact, though the fact "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_130,890290,893850,already exists somewhere in this world. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_131,893850,899250,But the society is not aware as to the existence of that fact. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_132,899250,906220,The focus of researcher is to explore those facts and to present those facts before the 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_133,906220,908990,society. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_134,908990,916770,In this research no preliminary data exists for assisting the researcher or to guide him 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_135,916770,921670,to proceed with his objective. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_136,921670,930920,"Mysterious facts, those facts which are dis… difficult to explain are searched and interpreted "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_137,930920,936850,and shown before the society by this exploration method. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_138,936850,946210,"After exploratory research, another kind of research is explanatory research. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_139,946210,951220,Object of this kind of research is the explanation of knowledge. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_140,951220,958370,"Any knowledge, any fact which exist in the society and society and group of peoples are "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_141,958370,964490,already know or aware with the existence of fact. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_142,964490,975100,"But their knowledge is somewhere is not perfect, if they are not aware as to the reality of "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_143,975100,986470,"that fact or their knowledge of reality is incomplete, mispleaded or inconsistent. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_144,986470,994770,The focus of researcher is to give the true explanation of the facts by which he can correct 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_145,994770,1001080,the social perception towards that concept of life. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_146,1001080,1006870,Because this is very necessary or what we can say this is matter of social development 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_147,1006870,1014170,"if the society at large is misleaded, mispleaded or having misconception towards the truth… "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_148,1014170,1017400,truthiness of any fact. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_149,1017400,1025089,This is the moral duty of the researcher to work on that particular social issue and explain 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_150,1025089,1028850,and make the society aware with the reality. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_151,1028850,1037660,"After explanatory research, another is diagnostic research, where any problem exist in the society. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_152,1037660,1044930,"Peoples are affected by that problem, but they have no knowledge how to resolve that "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_153,1044930,1052669,"problem, where the causes or the variables of such problem which causing the existence "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_154,1052669,1060549,"of problem, subsistence of problem are not known by this researcher. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_155,1060549,1069840,"This research, researcher exercise to find out causes or variables responsible for origin, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_156,1069840,1077769,"existence and subsistence of problem, and finally he diagnose the causes of any problem. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_157,1077769,1086289,This is also called the causal research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_158,1086289,1094649,"After causal research, another important research is remedial research, where the causes of "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_159,1094649,1097619,any problem are already known to the society. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_160,1097619,1103799,"But, how to cope up that problem, that is the question. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_161,1103799,1108720,"Causes of problem have already identified, how to prevent or control such problem is "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_162,1108720,1111299,a question. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_163,1111299,1118960,"By this research, researcher try to investigate those facts or variables which can be useful "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_164,1118960,1126169,for controlling or eradication of such social problem. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_165,1126169,1132509,"After remedial prob, research, another research is comparative research. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_166,1132509,1139000,"Object of this research is the comparison of two or more groups, phenomena, society, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_167,1139000,1144360,"policy, instrument, principles or theories. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_168,1144360,1151330,"Here the research, researcher makes the comparison between two or more set of principles, theories "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_169,1151330,1152600,or groups. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_170,1152600,1158899,"And after analyzing them, he comes with the conclusion that which particular theory or "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_171,1158899,1164580,model is beneficial to achieve any defined objective. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_172,1164580,1168910,The next research is experimental research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_173,1168910,1178429,"In experimental research, effects of variable is observed by controlling and manipulating "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_174,1178429,1179679,the variables. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_175,1179679,1189590,Here the researcher has control over the variables used in the research and he try to study the 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_176,1189590,1196710,effects of their manipulation or their reaction with the other variable. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_177,1196710,1207220,"This research is performed with objective to test the va, the variables or testing of "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_178,1207220,1209799,the hypothesis. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_179,1209799,1215850,Testing of variables is also called the laboratory research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_180,1215850,1220869,Experimental researches are rarely used in legal research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_181,1220869,1228231,"Historical research is another kind of research having its own distinct objective, and this "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_182,1228231,1231809,is very important kind of research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_183,1231809,1242549,"By this research, past facts or evidences are studied systematically and chronologically. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_184,1242549,1250940,"By past events, researcher try to explain the present phenomena, present condition and "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_185,1250940,1256720,it can also be beneficial for the future decisions. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_186,1256720,1264019,"In this research, researcher collects the scattered recorded facts and analyze them "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_187,1264019,1271369,and summarize to give a valid statement as to the past events. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_188,1271369,1277629,"After this classification of research on the basis of objectives, come with the research "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_189,1277629,1278629,process. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_190,1278629,1282130,Research process contain three major steps. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_191,1282130,1286739,"First part that is the collection of data, second, analysis of data and third one is "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_192,1286739,1289619,the interpretation of data. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_193,1289619,1298080,"In all these three stages, the researcher required the skill, analytical methods to, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_194,1298080,1301669,"for collection, analysis and interpretation of data. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_195,1301669,1309269,"With this process, the researcher interest with the re… research is to know about their "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_196,1309269,1310869,importance. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_197,1310869,1318399,Importance of research can be explained in the words of Juris Hudson said that all progress 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_198,1318399,1320799,is born of enquiry. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_199,1320799,1328169,"Doubt is often better than overconfidence, for it leads to enquiry, and enquiry leads "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_200,1328169,1330470,to investigation. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_201,1330470,1338980,Research progress somewhere beneficial for future actions or decisions. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_202,1338980,1346110,"Where the person is aware about the reality, truthiness of the facts and the phenomena "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_203,1346110,1352090,he can take the best decision as to his life. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_204,1352090,1362989,Karl Pearson has stated about the importance of research in very nice composition of words 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_205,1362989,1370870,"that is there is no shortcut to the earth, there is no shortcut to the truth, no way "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_206,1370870,1377690,"to gain knowledge of the universe, except through the gateway of scientific method. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_207,1377690,1387360,"He has advocated the use of scientific methods, scientific investigation to know the reality. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_208,1387360,1394840,"For the law scholars after understanding the basics of research, it is necessary to explain "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_209,1394840,1399679,about the nature of legal research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_210,1399679,1401590,Le… 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_211,1401590,1410750,Legal research is the subject related to the social science approach because law is the 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_212,1410750,1419750,"normative science, law cannot be studied independently. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_213,1419750,1428710,"Law is an instrument to control the social behavior, social ordering, that is why the "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_214,1428710,1438149,"legal research has to be studied in the life, light of social phenomena, but the characteristic "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_215,1438149,1444879,of legal research is distinct from other streams of social science because of its distinct 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_216,1444879,1447929,authoritative sources of knowledge. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_217,1447929,1453519,"Basic sources of knowledge are the legislation, precedent and customs. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_218,1453519,1463799,Juristic writ… writing is another common source frequently used in legal researches. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_219,1463799,1467700,"Society is a dynamic concept, so law cannot be static. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_220,1467700,1476179,That is why the legal research is very important for the social development and social utility. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_221,1476179,1484720,Objective of legal research can be explained in following points – finding out the objectives 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_222,1484720,1491809,"of existing law and customs, to check their utility in changing social demands, to find "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_223,1491809,1501360,"out the lacuna if any exist and to take the necessary steps to overcome such problem, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_224,1501360,1508169,to find out the possibilities of prevention and control of social evils by enactment and 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_225,1508169,1518239,"improvement of law, providing spo… space and improvement and importance to new and "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_226,1518239,1525679,"changing technologies affecting individual rights, social order and legislative provisions, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_227,1525679,1530629,"their implementation, enforcement and infringement. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_228,1530629,1537629,Comparison of two or more legislations resulting conflict is also a common object of legal 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_229,1537629,1538629,research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_230,1538629,1547029,"To discover new facts, test and verify old facts, analyze the facts in new technol, theoretical "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_231,1547029,1553299,framework can be the objective of legal research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_232,1553299,1558009,There are some specific procedural models and method which are commonly used in legal 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_233,1558009,1560070,research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_234,1560070,1567720,"These are evolutive, explicative, identificatory, collative, impact analysis and interactive "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_235,1567720,1569590,model. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_236,1569590,1581759,Evolutive model contain the procedure by which roots of social evils are identified and their 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_237,1581759,1587149,prohibition and control is suggested by the legal research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_238,1587149,1593259,Evolutionary theory was basically propounded by Darwin. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_239,1593259,1600539,"He said, that evolutionary theory is a theory directed at explaining the present by looking "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_240,1600539,1602779,at his past. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_241,1602779,1612519,"Second, explicative model - explicative model is used with certain objectives in legal research, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_242,1612519,1620919,"where the objective of research is to ascertain the nature, scope and sources of any law, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_243,1620919,1624139,legislation or any statute. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_244,1624139,1634340,"And the stated sources, legislation and nature are compared with their real social condition. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_245,1634340,1641549,"And there after any conclusion may be drawn as to the real nature of law, objectives and "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_246,1641549,1646019,limitations of law can also be focused by this method. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_247,1646019,1657539,"Third is identificatory model – this model has the direct approach towards the finding, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_248,1657539,1663649,"searching those persons, beneficiaries of any law, legislative schemes or provision "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_249,1663649,1665759,of law. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_250,1665759,1674320,If any law has been enacted with certain objective and there its objective is denoting that certain 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_251,1674320,1679940,class of group is the beneficiary of this legislative scheme. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_252,1679940,1686859,The purpose of researcher is to check this thing whether this legislation is actually 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_253,1686859,1690729,serving the stated objectives or not. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_254,1690729,1697940,"Or is there any other person behind the curtain, who is the beneficiary of these provisions "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_255,1697940,1700690,and schemes. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_256,1700690,1708989,"Next is projective model – projective model is used to find out the attitude, responsiveness "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_257,1708989,1715909,and reactivity of the society towards particular piece of legislation. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_258,1715909,1724249,"Invitation of public opinion before introducing any new legislation or amending existing one, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_259,1724249,1731460,so that difficulties arise in implementation of policy can overcome. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_260,1731460,1742179,Survey method is usually used with this projective model to find out the social response towards 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_261,1742179,1745090,any legislative action. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_262,1745090,1752970,Next is collative model – The collative model makes the comparison between two existing 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_263,1752970,1756620,"law, provisions of law, models of law. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_264,1756620,1763309,Its objective is to compare two rules to find out which one is more workable and by which 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_265,1763309,1768429,the desired effect may be achieved. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_266,1768429,1771490,Next is impact analysis. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_267,1771490,1780399,By the term itself you can understand that impact ana… analysis process is focused 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_268,1780399,1790220,"to find out the impact of any rule, legislative principle, provisions on society. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_269,1790220,1796210,"Here the impact of legal principles, rules and institution on society are studied. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_270,1796210,1808059,"And, if any deficiency found in their relation it is corrected by the researcher suggestion. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_271,1808059,1815700,"For necessary changes can be made for improvement, these are the objective of impact analysis. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_272,1815700,1824029,"After impact analysis, another model is interactive model. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_273,1824029,1830879,Study the involvement of some other factors while interaction of legal provision with 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_274,1830879,1831929,the society. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_275,1831929,1839899,"During the interaction of law with the social phenomena, other factors variables, which "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_276,1839899,1847590,"are interacted their role, their nature and effects are studied. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_277,1847590,1854659,The focus of researcher in this model is to find out the evidences showing the interaction 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_278,1854659,1860489,"of certain variables, their nature and effects on the law and society. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_279,1860489,1870149,"After discussing about this basic approach of research, technical sense of research, "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_280,1870149,1876809,"procedure applied for research, this is the time to conclude the lecture. "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_281,1876809,1884840,Research is a systematic process of investigating unknown facts or explanation of existing facts 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_282,1884840,1887720,with certain objectives. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_283,1887720,1898159,Here the systematic process can be achieved by following the scientific methods suggested 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_284,1898159,1899799,for this thing. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_285,1899799,1905350,In scientific method there are various approved models and researcher can select any of the 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_286,1905350,1910269,model according to objective and purpose of research. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_287,1910269,1917179,"Role of legal researchers are also important in finding, analyzing and explaining the relation "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_288,1917179,1919559,of law and society. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_289,1919559,1928649,Methods which are used for ordinary research in social science streams are also usually 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_290,1928649,1934990,applicable in legal law researches. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_291,1934990,1945309,"But these methods are opted in law stream with certain modifications, certain amendments "
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_292,1945309,1950129,which are necessary to satisfy the purpose within the scopes of legal regime. 
Module_1_Basics_of_Research_293,1950129,1955489,Thank you on my part. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_0,229,4680,"Hello everyone, as we have reached to the fag end of Research Methodology course, today "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_1,4680,9530,we are going to discuss a very important topic called Drawing Conclusion. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_2,9530,13499,As you all know I am Doctor Ritu Sharma and I have been dealing with Research Methodology 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_3,13499,19150,"modules and today we are going to discuss how to draw conclusion, because that is the "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_4,19150,21810,most important part of the research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_5,21810,27199,"So, in this module you will learn that to understand the role of conclusion and what "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_6,27199,29199,role does it play in research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_7,29199,34590,"And then it will also, we will also discuss the importance of a good conclusion and we "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_8,34590,39100,will explain the structure of a good conclusion and finally we will examine the problem that 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_9,39100,42550,we need to avoid while writing a conclusion. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_10,42550,49399,And we will also see various steps that we can use in the process of drawing conclusion. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_11,49399,54969,"So, drawing conclusion, as I told you is one of the most important activities in research "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_12,54969,60039,as it gives the final critical reflection of the research conducted. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_13,60039,65380,The conclusion plays an important role as it determines the success or failure of a research.  
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_14,65380,71340,"Whether we conduct a doctrinal or empirical research, it is the final conclusion that "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_15,71340,73550,makes research a success. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_16,73550,80230,"If we, if the result of the research is satisfying and the experimentation is excellent but conclusion "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_17,80230,84660,"is weak, then the result of the research will not be appreciated. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_18,84660,88700,"Thus, drawing conclusion plays a very important role. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_19,88700,94200,A conclusion helps the reader in understanding the research conducted and how it will be helpful to them.  
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_20,95200,98869,It also helps in paving the way for future research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_21,98869,104370,"It is just not a summary, but also gives key point to the research. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_22,104370,107840,The conclusion of a research has three important points. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_23,107840,113580,"One, it gives an ending to your project and highlights what a research result means. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_24,113580,120830,"Second, it helps the researcher in explaining how his or her research contributes to the new knowledge.  "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_25,120830,125080,"Third, it gives an impression of the work done by the researcher. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_26,125080,131370,"Now, when we talk about this introduction, we should also know that what is the importance "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_27,131370,137569,of a good conclusion and here we are going to quote David Bunton who has pointed out 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_28,137569,139790,the importance of a good conclusion. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_29,139790,146080,He says that a well written conclusion provides you with important opportunity to de… demonstrate 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_30,146080,150069,to the reader your understanding of the research problem. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_31,150069,155540,"And these include, first, presenting the last word on the issue you raised in your paper. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_32,155540,160989,"So, just as the introduction gives the first impression to your reader, the conclusion "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_33,160989,164170,offers a chance to leave a lasting impression. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_34,164170,170430,"Do this, for example, by highlighting key points in your analysis for results or by "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_35,170430,177230,pointing important or unexpected implications applied or practiced. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_36,177230,183270,"Second, summarising your thoughts and conveying the larger significance of your study. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_37,183270,190099,"The conclusion is an opportunity to succinctly answer the question, “so what?” by placing "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_38,190099,195400,the study within the context of the past research about the topic you have investigated. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_39,195400,199879,"Then, it identifies how a gap in the literature has been addressed. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_40,199879,201840,This is a third point. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_41,201840,207749,The conclusion can be where you describe how a previous identified gap in the literature 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_42,207749,212530,"described the, in your literature review has been filled by your research. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_43,212530,217299,"So, it actually fil, fulfils the gap which is already there in the research. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_44,217299,224639,"So, when you are concluding, you give a kind of idea to the person that till now in literature "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_45,224639,229670,this was the gap and my research is actually fulfilling that gap.

Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_47,235010,240701,"Now, in conclusion, when you are writing a conclusion you...you should not be shy. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_48,240701,247299,It should offer you the opportunity to elaborate on the impact and significance of your findings. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_49,247299,252680,"So, your idea also plays a very important role when you are actually writing a conclusion. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_50,252680,260090,"Then, introducing possible new or expanded ways of thinking about the research problem. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_51,260090,264440,"Once you have conducted your research, once you have got the result, you are writing a "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_52,264440,271090,"conclusion and this writing of conclusion does not refer to introducing new information, "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_53,271090,277440,because it should be avoided but to offer a new insight and creative approach for framing 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_54,277440,283950,"or contextualizing the research problem based on the result of your study, because by coming "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_55,283950,288720,"to a conclusion you have already seen the various aspects of the research, and when "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_56,288720,294730,"you are actually observing the various aspects, you also know that where a new field can also "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_57,294730,298430,"be opened after your research, right? "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_58,298430,307850,"So, then it will, as a result it will be introducing new or expanded ways of thinking about the research problem.  "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_59,307850,314320,"Now, as we have understood what is the significance of a good conclusion, we should also understand "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_60,314320,317690,what should be a structure of a good conclusion. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_61,317690,323370,Joseph Assan has discussed the structure and the writing style of the conclusion. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_62,323370,329180,"He says while writing a conclusion, a researcher should follow some points. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_63,329180,335920,"For example, first, it should state the conclusion very clearly, very sim… in a very simple "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_64,335920,342940,language and it should state how the findings differ or support those of the others and why  
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_65,342940,348430,"It should not simply reiterate your results, or the discussions of your results, it should  "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_66,348430,355090,provide a synthesis of arguments presented in the paper to show how all these coverge 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_67,355090,360650,to address the research problems and the overall objective of your study. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_68,360650,366860,"So, it should indicate opportunities for future research if you haven’t already done so "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_69,366860,369550,in the discussion section of your paper. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_70,369550,375000,"And finally, it should highlight the need for future research, which provides the reader "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_71,375000,380060,with evidence that you have an in depth awareness of the research problem. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_72,380060,387570,He further says that the function of your paper’s conclusion is to restate the main argument.  
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_73,387570,393130,It reminds the reader of the strength of your main arguments and reiterates the most important 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_74,393130,395330,evidence supporting those arguments. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_75,395330,403770,"So, do this by stating clearly the content, background, and necessity of pursuing the "

Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_77,409580,411440,in the literature. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_78,411440,418520,"Make sure, however, that your conclusion is not simply a repetitive summary of the findings. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_79,418520,424250,This reduces the impact of the arguments you have developed in your study. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_80,424250,430720,"According to him, a researcher should consider the following points to help ensure that his "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_81,430720,432980,conclusion is appropriate. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_82,432980,438980,"One, if the argument or purpose of your paper is complex, you may need to summarise the "

Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_112,591550,597351,The research guide of the University of Southern California mentions about the points we need 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_113,597351,601779,to keep in mind and problems to avoid while writing conclusion. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_114,601779,609509,"According to them, a researcher usually makes the following mistakes while writing a conclusion. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_115,609509,616769,"One, a conclusion should be concise, it should be concise and to the point and should not "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_116,616769,619990,have unnecessary information in it. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_117,619990,628290,The researcher’s emphasis should be on implications and evaluation rather than on methodological details 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_118,628290,636220,"Secondly, focus should be on significant issues, because the job of the researcher is to use "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_119,636220,640829,"deduction method, the introduction and the induction method, the conclusion. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_120,640829,647000,"In other words, a researcher should place his or her research in the larger context "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_121,647000,652100,by focusing on the contribution it has made in the research field. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_122,652100,655110,"Then, do not ignore the negative results. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_123,655110,660490,A researcher should definitely talk about the problems and challenges encountered by 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_124,660490,665199,him or her as it will make his or her research rich. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_125,665199,671360,The challenges faced by the researcher will pave way for the future research and this 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_126,671360,675620,will be a success for a researcher. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_127,675620,680430,"Then he, he or she should provide a clear summary of the research. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_128,680430,687019,"The summarisation that is done in the conclusion should be very clear, or in other words a "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_129,687019,690519,summary should always be succunt. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_130,690519,693309,Conclusion should match your objectives. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_131,693309,697269,"When you are starting your research, you always highlight the objective. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_132,697269,700930,Remember that your conclusion should match your objective. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_133,700930,706899,A conclusion should always reflect on the researcher’s achievement of his objective. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_134,706899,714110,"Then, it shou..., it shows if the researcher has accomplished what he intended to accomplish "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_135,714110,716559,"in his, in his or her research. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_136,716559,722800,It actually shows that if the researcher has accomplished what he intended to accomplish 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_137,722800,724790,in his or her research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_138,724790,732459,"If there is anything, if there is any discrepancy then the researcher should document the re… "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_139,732459,738629,reasons and try to use it as a data in the research and if possible should try to go 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_140,738629,742389,back and refine the original objectives. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_141,742389,748999,"Then, finally, conclusion should reflect researcher’s confidence about his or her research. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_142,748999,756399,"A researcher whe..., a researcher when conducts a research he has a thorough understanding "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_143,756399,758649,of his research than anyone else. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_144,758649,764269,"So, he should take advantage of this fact and should try to reflect that confidence "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_145,764269,768019,and understanding of the research in his conclusion. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_146,768019,774459,"Now, as we have understood what is a good conclusion, how to write con, a good conclusion, "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_147,774459,781220,"what should be avoided while writing a con..., good conclusion, let’s focus on how a good, "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_148,781220,784529,how a good conclusion is drawn. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_149,784529,793779,"So, Shuttleworth has described few points in highlighting, or in explaining how to draw a conclusion.  "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_150,793779,800960,He sums up the whole thing in a very succintly manner and he says that the researcher can 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_151,800960,805379,"draw the conclusion in one or, in these five points. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_152,805379,807569,"One, what he has learnt? "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_153,807569,814420,First thing is his conclusion should focus that what he has learnt in his research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_154,814420,819699,"The researcher will summarize what they have learnt from the research, and their findings "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_155,819699,820990,of the research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_156,820990,825610,Doing so he or she should try to assess strength of the hypothesis. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_157,825610,833100,"For example, in a research if a null hypothesis is acceptable, the researcher can analyse "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_158,833100,838579,why the results were not as per the predictions in his or her conclusion. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_159,838579,842490,This will make his or her conclusion very strong. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_160,842490,848490,"The researcher, the researches where there is no hypothesis like the onal research, the "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_161,848490,854709,researcher will analyse the findings and will try to establish if any valuable information 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_162,854709,857240,is not covered. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_163,857240,859009,Aspects for the future research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_164,859009,864660,"The one, When you are drawing conclusion it should have aspects for the future research, "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_165,864660,868329,because all researches leads to new research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_166,868329,874050,A good conclusion should deal with the aspects of the future research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_167,874050,877439,All researches lead to new research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_168,877439,883699,"Most of the researches uncovers the new questions, and researchers can use these to suggest new "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_169,883699,886630,directions for the future study. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_170,886630,894850,"If the hypothesis is accepted, the research results are as predicted by the researcher, "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_171,894850,898100,"and if a hypothesis is not accepted, it paves way for the future research. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_172,898100,902749,"Then, one should evaluate the flaws in the research. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_173,902749,908019,The researcher should try to analyse the problems that occur during the experiment. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_174,908019,914269,"First of all, he or she should try to analyse the errors in the research design that can "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_175,914269,916929,influence the results in any manner. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_176,916929,922269,All experiments suffer some or the other kind of weakness error. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_177,922269,927930,The researcher should able to justify the methodology and should try to give reasoning 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_178,927930,930809,for the errors that have occurred in the experiment. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_179,930809,933889,Shuttleworth explains this with a beautiful example. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_180,933889,941510,He says that while drawing conclusion the researcher may think that another variable 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_181,941510,947679,influence the results and this variable was not eliminated during the experiment process. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_182,947679,954019,"A refined version of the experiment may help to achieve better results, if the new effect "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_183,954019,956860,is included in the design process. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_184,956860,962959,"So, giving example of global warming he says that, “in the global warming example the "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_185,962959,971120,"researcher might establish that, Carbon Dioxide   emission alone cannot be responsible for global warming. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_186,971120,980860,"They may decide that another effect is contributing, so purpose is that methane may also be a factor in global warming. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_187,980860,983720,A new study would incorporate methane into the model.” 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_188,983720,992850,This argument also supports our previous point that deals with the new aspects for the future research.  
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_189,992850,997540,"Then, a conclusion should also talk about the benefits of the research. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_190,997540,1004319,"Once the researcher has evaluated the flaws, the researcher he, he or she should evaluate "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_191,1004319,1007660,the advantage and benefits of the research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_192,1007660,1012980,"In explaining this point, Shuttleworth gives an example from the medicine and psychology "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_193,1012980,1020259,"field and says that, “in medicine and psychology the result may throw out a new way of treating "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_194,1020259,1024589,"a medical problem, so the advantages are obvious. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_195,1024589,1031620,"However, all well-constructed research is used, even if it is just adding to the fount "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_196,1031620,1033510,of the human knowledge.” 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_197,1033510,1038059,Suggestions based on the conclusions are very important. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_198,1038059,1043980,"The last stage and one of the most important stage is the recommendation stage, which is "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_199,1043980,1048089,based upon the results of researcher’s field study. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_200,1048089,1055279,"Researcher could make suggestions for refinement or, of the experimental design or highlight "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_201,1055279,1058669,the interesting areas for the further study. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_202,1058669,1064809,This final piece of the researcher’s paper is the most critical and pulls together all 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_203,1064809,1071040,the findings and as stated earlier it will pave way for the new research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_204,1071040,1074510,"So, the this is the most important part. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_205,1074510,1078850,"Then finally, when you are summarising in a conclusion. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_206,1078850,1081960,The strength of the result is summarising. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_207,1081960,1087960,The most important part about drawing conclusion is to check if the method and methodology 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_208,1087960,1092080,"used correctly, is used correctly in the research. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_209,1092080,1097799,This also calls for following of the steps of scientific research and design correctly. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_210,1097799,1106510,"If the research design is strong, then the focus would be conclusion rat… rather than the method. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_211,1106510,1111750,Shuttleworth explained the above points and make it very easy for a researcher to draw 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_212,1111750,1114850,conclusion in a very effective manner. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_213,1114850,1120240,As we have analysed the various aspects of drawing and writing a conclusion like importance 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_214,1120240,1125340,"of a good conclusion, structure of a good conclusion, and things to avoid while dra… "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_215,1125340,1130539,"drawing conclusion, let’s briefly talk about the step that are needed in the process of "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_216,1130539,1131750,writing a conclusion. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_217,1131750,1137409,"The first step that is needed in writing a conclusion is, that the researcher should "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_218,1137409,1143330,"gather all the information at one place, write down each of the hypothesis and arrange the "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_219,1143330,1150539,"data from each dependent variable under its corresponding hypothesis, attach the result "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_220,1150539,1153710,of the statistical analysis with each hypothesis. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_221,1153710,1160399,If the data collected passes the test of reliability and validity as it will help the researcher 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_222,1160399,1164770,to decide if the hypothesis is false or true. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_223,1164770,1171309,But remember that the reliability and validity need not be perfect to provide useful information. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_224,1171309,1177570,"So, while drawing conclusion a researcher must try to check all the following points. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_225,1177570,1183380,"One, first of all the researcher should check if he has answered the ‘so what’ question "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_226,1183380,1190039,"in the research, or in other words what his or her research means or trying to say, or "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_227,1190039,1197250,"if the researcher has explained what the finding of his research, his or her research mean. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_228,1197250,1204409,The researcher should check if he or she has outlined the implication of his or her research 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_229,1204409,1210090,"for academic understanding and if the implications are the policy, are for policy practice. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_230,1210090,1218990,The researcher should also check if he or she has highlighted the limitations of his 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_231,1218990,1224950,or her research and his or her work is able to suggest areas of future research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_232,1224950,1232679,"A researcher need to provide a convincing explanation of his research, which is loud, "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_233,1232679,1236190,clearly so that it looks nice. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_234,1236190,1242760,"Finally, he or she needs to proof read his conclusion so that all the errors can be checked. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_235,1242760,1249320,"Now, as we have understood the various steps and the, what is drawing conclusion, let’s "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_236,1249320,1252720,revise what we have done in this module. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_237,1252720,1258659,"So, in this module we have actually explained how do we draw conclusion. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_238,1258659,1263870,"So, drawing conclusion an important research process, which helps the researcher in forming "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_239,1263870,1266760,an impression of his or her research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_240,1266760,1272400,"The conclusion of the research not only summarises the researcher’s thought, but explain the "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_241,1272400,1276640,contributions of the research conducted by him or her. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_242,1276640,1282340,"Thus, the, one can say that the conclusion of a research helps the researcher in giving "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_243,1282340,1287990,a blueprint of his research and leaves a last impression in the minds of the reader. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_244,1287990,1292950,The best or the most important role played by the conclusion is that it generates the 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_245,1292950,1296010, new aspects for the future research. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_246,1296010,1302480,"Thank you so much, I hope you are learning a lot from these modules of research methodology. "
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_247,1302480,1303902,For any queries you can write to me. 
Module_32_Drawing_Conclusion_248,1303902,1303919,Thank you so much. 
Intro_RM_0,8330,15260,"Hello viewers. I am Professor GS Bajpai at the National Law University, Delhi. I welcome "
Intro_RM_1,15260,23360,"you to the course on Research Methodology under M O O C S. Friends, this course is dedicated "
Intro_RM_2,23360,30300,"to the students of law in the field of research methodology. However, other students can also "
Intro_RM_3,30300,35680,"be getting benefitted from this course. So, what is so special about this course when "
Intro_RM_4,35680,40910,there are already several course available online? I will just briefly tell you that 
Intro_RM_5,40910,45970,"there are so many important questions in the field of law, which requires the answer in "
Intro_RM_6,45970,53100,"a very objective manner. Like for instance, why people obey the law? What is impact of "
Intro_RM_7,53100,62269,"law? How a law amendment will ha, will impact the state in terms of manpower, resources? "
Intro_RM_8,62269,69900,"How much crime we have in the society? Friends, you can always answer these questions "
Intro_RM_9,69900,75630,"through your impressions. But here, I have to stress that these questions have to be "
Intro_RM_10,75630,81770,"answered objectively. When you try to answer these question objectively, you are entering "
Intro_RM_11,81770,87550,"to the domain of research methodology. In this course, friends, we would be talking "
Intro_RM_12,87550,93800,"about two aspects of research methodology. First, we will try to understand the fundamentals "
Intro_RM_13,93800,101610,"of research methodology, where I will try to explain you the different types of research "
Intro_RM_14,101610,107650,"and also the different types of tools in research, which would be very useful from the viewpoint "
Intro_RM_15,107650,112040,"of legal research. And then from the viewpoint of a law students, "
Intro_RM_16,112040,117860,I would also like you to understand the Doctrinal and Non Doctrinal part of legal research which 
Intro_RM_17,117860,124900,"is also known as qualitative and quantitative research method. And through this course, "
Intro_RM_18,124900,130479,we would also like you to know the different parameters of the framing of research which 
Intro_RM_19,130479,137780,"would include the statement of research, objective building, hypothesis building and of course "
Intro_RM_20,137780,145390,"the tools for data collection, sampling techniques, data analysis, ethics in research, applications "
Intro_RM_21,145390,150270,"of software in legal research. In the second part of this course, we would "
Intro_RM_22,150270,156790,be talking about the applications of legal research in solving different types of questions. 
Intro_RM_23,156790,162150,"So, in the end, the learners would be in a position to develop a research proposal.  "
Intro_RM_24,162150,169920,They would also be able to answer several research queries by the application of research methodology. 
Intro_RM_25,169920,177580,"And I would also say, that at the post-graduation level and L L M programs, the research methodology "
Intro_RM_26,177580,182650,"is a core paper. You can choose this course for your, for the "
Intro_RM_27,182650,187460,purpose of the your core paper. And there this course would be immensely useful. This 
Intro_RM_28,187460,193740,"course is supposed to be five credit course for that purpose. And I would say in the end, "
Intro_RM_29,193740,199880,that I can promise that this course would provide you a very exciting opportunity to 
Intro_RM_30,199880,206980,learn research methodology in most interesting way. I call upon you to join this course and 
Intro_RM_31,206980,214180,you will be enriching your knowledge and skills on a subject of research methodology in law 
Intro_RM_32,214180,217500,which is not so well received so far in the country. Thank you. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_0,599,1599,Hello everyone. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_1,1599,5810,Welcome back to another new module of Research Methodology called Research Proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_2,5810,11330,Hope you are learning a lot from the other modules and we have reached to a level where 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_3,11330,13240,we can write a proposal now. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_4,13240,17620,And writing a proposal is a very important part and that’s the reason MOOCs has taken 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_5,17620,23110,"initiative or putting it in a Research Methodology module, so that you get a better understanding "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_6,23110,28400,"of writing a proposal, which is also helpful in gaining all kinds of research prob… pro… "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_7,28400,29470,research experience. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_8,29470,33719,"So, if you remember as we have discussed earlier, I am Doctor Ritu Sharma. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_9,33719,36390,"We are, we’ll go by the same scheme. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_10,36390,42050,"We’ll introduce the concept first that is, what is the role of the proposal within research. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_11,42050,44089,We’ll understand the meaning of research proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_12,44089,49680,"We will try to identify distinction between quantitative and qualitative proposal, then "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_13,49680,54120,we will examine if there is a formula for writing a successful research proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_14,54120,58659,"Finally, we’ll provide a frame work structure for a research pro… proposal. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_15,58659,61769,"Now, why do we need a research proposal? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_16,61769,66740,"In order to address the major questions and issues of everyday social life, the researcher "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_17,66740,70060,may well need to conduct empirical work of some description. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_18,70060,74700,"However, such research pro… work is not an isolated activity. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_19,74700,79700,"It is a social activity that has potential repercussions for others, whether that be "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_20,79700,84729,the people or the organization or the culture that we are studying or the people that we 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_21,84729,88810,work with as student or employee or community group members. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_22,88810,93500,"For instance, a project idea that aims to investigate work place harassment needs to "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_23,93500,100229,consider all sorts of matter that one might not initially consider to be part of the research process. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_24,100229,106280,Such matters might include the potentiality trau… traumatising impact on respondents 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_25,106280,112800,"who might themselves have been victims of bullying, but have lived with this in enforced silence. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_26,112800,118600,"Or perhaps as a consequence of the research revealing endemic yet hidden workplace bullying, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_27,118600,124929,"the employing organisation may find itself the target of a law suit, by failing to provide "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_28,124929,128140,adequate duty of care of employees. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_29,128140,133290,Whether you are a student intending to commence with the masters or doctoral research program 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_30,133290,139460,"or a project leader applying for func… funding, support your research idea will need to be "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_31,139460,147100,assessed by others and you will need to present a convincing case in the form of a research proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_32,147100,152710,All researchers should therefore be able to prepare a proposal for a research topic a professional standard. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_33,152710,157640,Being able to produce such a proposal is an important skill. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_34,157640,162140,Intending doctoral students are required to prepare such a proposal when applying for 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_35,162140,166560,studentship and seeking formal registration for their project. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_36,166560,171420,The research proposal is the means by which we are able to demonstrate that we are ab… 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_37,171420,173160,what we are able to do. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_38,173160,179780,"As such, it allows us to spell out what exactly is the research problem that we are retai… "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_39,179780,181250,intending to investigate. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_40,181250,186220,Why this is worthy of investigation and how we intend to carry out the research? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_41,186220,191060,"In putting such a proposal together, we shall not only need to demonstrate a knowledge of "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_42,191060,196230,"the area in which we are interested, but also we require to show that we have the necessary "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_43,196230,200910,methodological competence and sensitivity to carry out the research. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_44,200910,203330,"Now, what is a research proposal? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_45,203330,209410,The research proposal is an application that is prepared by a student or a university academician 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_46,209410,215160,or professional researcher for support prior to embarking upon a research study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_47,215160,219740,At one level the objectives of a research propo… proposal may be seen as providing 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_48,219740,225380,"a statement about the purpose of the research, how it is to be carried out, the resource "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_49,225380,230610,implication of the proposed investigation as well as the timescales for completion. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_50,230610,233470,"At another level, however, the research proposal is an argument. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_51,233470,239660,"Through the document, you are presenting a case, in which the intention is to convince "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_52,239660,243590,others of the general merits and feasibility of the proposed study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_53,243590,250430,The research proposal should therefore aim to convey three key aspects of an intended research project. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_54,250430,253420,"First, its objective and scholarly significance. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_55,253420,255240,"Second, your technical qualifications. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_56,255240,258540,"Third, the level of funding required. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_57,258540,261750,"Now, how to draft a research proposal? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_58,261750,265661,"Prior to the da… drafting of a research proposal, the nature of the research design "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_59,265661,268130,is to be selected should be set out. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_60,268130,273960,Whether one is intending to adopt a broadly qualitative research design or a strategy 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_61,273960,278950,that is largely quantitative in nature is likely to affect the shape and the format 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_62,278950,280730,of the research proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_63,280730,286670,"Of course, those charged with the reviewing proposal would have very clear expectation "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_64,286670,293560,that certain content will be included in the proposal regardless of the intended research strategy. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_65,293560,298570,"However, some elements of a quantitative research proposal will not be included in a qualitative "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_66,298570,301820,research proposal and vice versa. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_67,301820,306650,"Furthermore, quantitative research proposals are likely to be more uniform than those designed "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_68,306650,309850,for broadly qualitative based studies. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_69,309850,314800,As Punch in his book on Introduction to Social Research- Qualitative and Qualitative Approaches 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_70,314800,320680,say that- It is easier in many respect to suggest proposal guidelines for a quantitative 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_71,320680,325860,"study, since there is a greater variety in qualitative studies and many qualitative studies "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_72,325860,329050,will be unfolding rather than pre-structured. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_73,329050,335210,An emerging study cannot be a specific in the proposal about its research question or 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_74,335210,337000,about details of the design. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_75,337000,340930,"When this is the case, the points need to be made in the proposal. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_76,340930,347660,In the remainder of this chapter the core elements of a research proposal will be rew… 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_77,347660,351680,"reviewed where appropriate, the specific aspects that are necessary for drafting either a qualitative "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_78,351680,353130,or quantitative research. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_79,353130,358490,"Now, let’s consider, ‘Is there a formula for writing successful research proposal?’ "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_80,358490,362230,"A research proposal, then is a written plan for a study. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_81,362230,366370,It spells out detail what the researcher intend to do. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_82,366370,372889,It permits others to learn about the intended research and to offer suggest for improving the study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_83,372889,378340,It helps the researcher to clarify what needs to be done and aims to avoid unintentional 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_84,378340,380470,pitfall or unknown problems. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_85,380470,385830,"Module is intended to serve as a general framework, not a definite set of instructions. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_86,385830,392110,The only general rule that must always be adhered to is that the research proposal should 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_87,392110,394490,be both succinct and complete. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_88,394490,400560,Other than that each university research committee or external funding agency will have its own 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_89,400560,406410,"expectation about the actual format of the research proposal, and some will be more explicit "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_90,406410,408360,than the others in this respect. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_91,408360,413490,Research proposal often vary significantly in terms of length. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_92,413490,420790,In some cases application forms that prescribe precisely what is wanted and will need to be completed. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_93,420790,426770,In other the researcher will have more latitude to decide upon the format of the project. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_94,426770,428528,"However, the onus will be on the researcher to bend to meet the requirement of the university "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_95,428528,429528,review committee or external funding agency. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_96,429528,432540,However the onus will be on the researcher to bend to meet the requirement of the university 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_97,432540,435440,review committee or external funding agency. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_98,435440,441880,"Finally, it is important to avoid using a discursive essay-like style, instead, you "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_99,441880,445220,should make plentiful use of headings and bullet points. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_100,445220,450740,If it is necessary to use references in any background or literature review section or 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_101,450740,453940,ins… for instance the Harvard style is to be preferred. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_102,453940,459070,Pay full attention to appearance and to use user friendliness. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_103,459070,462889,Let’s now sketch a outline of the proposed research. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_104,462889,468290,"In the absence of any forms of guidelines, there are general themes that you might use "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_105,468290,472540,"to structure your own research proposal, whether this is a postgraduate dissertation or an "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_106,472540,475760,application for external research funding. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_107,475760,483090,"However, what follows are elements of a proposal - You do not need to have each as a particular heading. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_108,483090,484720,First one will the title page. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_109,484720,490960,"A title page should include each of the following, one, your name, the title of the proposed "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_110,490960,496160,"project, any collaboration agency that have been involved in the preparation of the proposal, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_111,496160,503020,"the date of submission and if applicable, and the funding agency to which you are applying for support. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_112,503020,505639,Then you will be giving a abstract. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_113,505639,509120,Abstract is very important is very important because the abstract is the brief synopsis 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_114,509120,511220,of the planed research investigation. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_115,511220,517209,"It appears at the front of the proposal, but it is usually the last element to be written. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_116,517209,522899,"It should include two keys areas – The major objective of the proposed study, and the procedure "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_117,522899,528360,and general methodological strategy that are to be used in order to meet these objectives. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_118,528360,531759,The abstract should be approximately one page or less in length. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_119,531759,537190,"The abstract is an important strategic element of the proposal, and therefore, should be "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_120,537190,540970,afforded considerable att… attention in the drafting of your proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_121,540970,546270,"It serves three keys interlinked purposes- The reviewer should, usually reads it before "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_122,546270,552230,the fully proposal to gain a perspective of the study and of its expected significance. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_123,552230,557009,The reviewer uses it as a reference to the nature of the study if the project comes up for discussion.  
Module_20_Research_Proposal_124,557009,563060,It will sometime be the only part of the proposal that it ee… that is read when making preliminary 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_125,563060,565889,selection of applicants proposals. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_126,565889,568709,"Now, research problems to be investigated. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_127,568709,573699,"Another, next, next point is, the what type of research problem is to be investigated? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_128,573699,579670,There are usually four areas to be addressed in the section of the research proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_129,579670,584381,"The purpose of the study, a justification for the project, the specific research question "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_130,584381,590380,"that you intend to explore, and a definition of any key terms and concept that you will examine. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_131,590380,593519,"However, you will write only one section. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_132,593519,599399,"This must contain all these four aspects, you will not deal with each other under a separate heading. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_133,599399,604260,"Now, what is the purpose of the study that is also part of your project writing? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_134,604260,607990,You will need to state what the research purpose to investigate. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_135,607990,614470,"The purpose should be concise statement, providing a framework to which details are laid. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_136,614470,619790,Generally speaking any study should seek to clarify some aspect of the field of the interest 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_137,619790,624679,"that is considered important, thereby, contributing both to the overall knowledge in the field "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_138,624679,626439,and to current practice. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_139,626439,632769,"The researcher must make clear, why this particular study is important to investigate? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_140,632769,636009,That is the reason it it needs some kind of justification. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_141,636009,639399,You must present an argument for the work of the study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_142,639399,644079,This will usually form a substantial section of your research proposal and will require 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_143,644079,649079,"you to provide evidence that you have a, you have conducted a detailed literature review "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_144,649079,654490,"in the area, in order to demonstrate to the reader that you have , you have studied the "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_145,654490,660240,"field with insight and are therefore, well qualified to undertake the research. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_146,660240,666050,"Then, identify what is already known and by implication what is yet unknown – and therefore, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_147,666050,668730,worthy of empirical study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_148,668730,673910,Key questions to ask yourself at this point are- Have I identified the specific research 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_149,673910,676389,problem that I wish to investigate? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_150,676389,680420,Have I indicated what intend to do about this problem? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_151,680420,685300,Have I put forward an argument so as to why this problem is worthy of investigation? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_152,685300,690670,And have I based argument on a review and examination of key literature in the area? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_153,690670,692619,"Now, the research question. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_154,692619,697740,A very important aspect of research proposal is having research question. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_155,697740,702019,The particular research question that you intend to examine should be stated next. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_156,702019,708450,"These are usually but not always, a more specific form of the problem in question form. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_157,708450,714160,"For quantitative researchers, research hypotheses will be set out at this stage for reasons "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_158,714160,717329,of clarity and as a research strategy. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_159,717329,724249,"If a researcher has a hypothesis in mind, it should be stated as clearly and as concisely as possible. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_160,724249,729209,It is unnecessarily frustrating for a reader to have to in… infer what a study hypotheses 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_161,729209,730980,or hypotheses might be. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_162,730980,736720,"For qualitative researchers especially those adopting an emergent research design, the "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_163,736720,743179,actual research question and hypotheses will not become clear until the research has begun. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_164,743179,748339,"Typically, these begin to take shape in the course of data collection and analysis. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_165,748339,753769,"As Punch ha… notes that- If a tightly structured qualitative study is planned, the proposal "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_166,753769,758189,can proceed along similar lines to the quantitative proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_167,758189,764559,"Now, it a more emergent study is planned, where focus and structure will develop as the study proceeds. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_168,764559,767899,This points should be made in the research proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_169,767899,771510,"In the former case, there will be general and specific question. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_170,771510,776889,"In the latter case, there will only be general orienting and guiding research questions. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_171,776889,781610,"The researcher, research questions are often drafted as aims and objectives. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_172,781610,788980,These are the means by which what is to be attempted and what is to be accomplished are specified. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_173,788980,793269,The aims and the objectives should immediately follow your review of the existing literature 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_174,793269,798569,serving as a bridge between what has previously been investigated and what still needs to 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_175,798569,801829,be studied through your propos… proposed research. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_176,801829,807540,"They therefore, serve as a crucial part of the justification of your research proposal "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_177,807540,812910,and we suggest that you consider setting them out as a series of bullet points in order 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_178,812910,819449,to give them emphasis and to direct the reviewer’s attention to them. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_179,819449,820739,Aims of the research proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_180,820739,822949,The aim is statement of intent. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_181,822949,826579,It indicates the overall purpose and thrust of the research. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_182,826579,833360,It is also a statement of the main association and relationship that you seek to discover or establish. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_183,833360,837220,"In any proposed project, the aim should be small in number. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_184,837220,843299,Setting yourself too many aims indicates that you are probably embarking on more than one project. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_185,843299,848550,Example might include- To determine whether or not lecturing is the most beneficial and 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_186,848550,851310,preferred teaching strategy in the higher education. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_187,851310,858100,And to explore how health and safety legislation is applied in hospitals and to evaluate which 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_188,858100,860709,values tend to demonstrate management practices. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_189,860709,864230,To investigate the effects of alcoholism on the family. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_190,864230,866040,"Notice now, how one… "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_191,866040,868670,none of these aim is directly answerable. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_192,868670,875940,These aims will be answered by accumulating and integrating answers to a series of objectives that you set. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_193,875940,880230,"So, let’s understand the objectives of in a research proposal. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_194,880230,883230,The objectives are specific action statements. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_195,883230,888230,They can be perceived as stepping stones that eventually directs the study towards the more 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_196,888230,889949,"comprehensive statement, stated aims. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_197,889949,896449,They express in detail and in a more technical way than the aims. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_198,896449,898850,What is the research intended to achieve? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_199,898850,905399,"It may be it may be to explore, to identify, to describe, to explain, to understand, to "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_200,905399,910220,"discover, to predict, to measure, to evaluate, to establish, to assess, to ascertain, to "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_201,910220,913920,determine or simply to find out. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_202,913920,919989,"So, a key question to ask yourself when drafting your objective is- Is it clear which data "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_203,919989,923009,are required to address in each objective? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_204,923009,928360,An example taken from Kumar’s book on Research Methodology- A step by step guide for beginners 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_205,928360,935779,provides objectives for the aim listed above concealing the study of alcoholism in the family. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_206,935779,942399,The project objectives are- To ascertain the impact of alcoholism on martial relationship. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_207,942399,949049,Then to determine the ways in which alcoholism affect the different aspects of children’s lives. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_208,949049,954239,And then to find out the effects of alcoholism on the financial situation of the family. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_209,954239,958220,"So, such objectives help to define the scope of the study. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_210,958220,963939,"As Kumar asserts, they should be worded in such a way that the wording clearly, completely "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_211,963939,966929,and specifically communicates your intentions. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_212,966929,972970,"There is no place for ambiguity, non-specificity or incompleteness. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_213,972970,976949,Either in the wording of your objective or the ideas they communicate. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_214,976949,980980,"Now, we have understood the objectives. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_215,980980,985089,Some key question you should ask yourself when you are for… for framing the objectives. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_216,985089,992449,Do the aims and the objectives adequately encapsulate the lull scope of the proposed project? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_217,992449,998300,Does or do the aims clearly indicate the overarching thrust of the intended study? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_218,998300,1003920,Or the objectives sufficiently precise so that they indicate clearly what is to be done 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_219,1003920,1008170,in order to collect the data necessary to address the research aims? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_220,1008170,1012869,"Are the, are there logical connections between the aims and the objectives? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_221,1012869,1016490,Or do I have any hypothesis in mind? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_222,1016490,1020339,If so have I expressed them clearly and appropriately? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_223,1020339,1025300,And then do I intent to investigate a relationship between difference phenomena or variable? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_224,1025300,1029679,"If so, have I indicated the variable that I think may be related? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_225,1029679,1035019,The next stage for the development of research proposal is the review of literature. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_226,1035019,1039900,"It was noted earlier that in order to gain support for a proposal project, the researcher "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_227,1039900,1043039,will need to conduct a review of the literature. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_228,1043039,1047299,In a research proposal the literature review is a partial summary of the previous work 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_229,1047299,1049940,related to the focus of the study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_230,1049940,1054700,You will need to de… demonstrate to a review committee that you are familiar with the major 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_231,1054700,1060510,trends in previous research as well as opinions on the topic and that you understand their 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_232,1060510,1062559,relevance to your planned study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_233,1062559,1067570,The major weakness of the many literature review is that people cite references without 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_234,1067570,1072000,indicating either their relevance or their implication for the planned study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_235,1072000,1076019,"Within any research proposal, a literature review is design to serve the twin purpose "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_236,1076019,1082980,"of explaining and justifying the decisions made about the nature of the research question, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_237,1082980,1086090,and also the methodological strategy to be adopted. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_238,1086090,1091909,The writer’s task is to employ the literature review artfully to support and explain the 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_239,1091909,1097130,"choices made for the study, not to educate the reader concerning the state of science "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_240,1097130,1099159,in the problem area. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_241,1099159,1101210,This is a very important point. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_242,1101210,1106830,"Many people are tempted to reference every study, every article, and every book that "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_243,1106830,1108019,they have read. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_244,1108019,1111990,For the purpose of setting out to impress the proposal reviewer that they are experts 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_245,1111990,1117990,in the field with a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of everything written in the area. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_246,1117990,1123190,"And of course, you need to review the literature related to your research question in order "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_247,1123190,1129550,for instance to identify a research gap that will serve as a stimulus for your study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_248,1129550,1135909,"However, the space available for you to develop this is in your research proposal will be limited. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_249,1135909,1141760,"You will therefore need to be concise in your review and refer only that work that is to, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_250,1141760,1144240,that is of direct relevance to your research question. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_251,1144240,1150549,The writer should set out the major concepts in an organised and lo… logical order and 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_252,1150549,1152440,then support these reference from the literature. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_253,1152440,1159049,Remember the literature review for a research proposal is somewhat different from that which 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_254,1159049,1162330,"you would do, use in a dissertation or a thesis. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_255,1162330,1166029,"It is quite obvious, more modest in scale and breadth. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_256,1166029,1171830,It is not the place to review body of literature that bears on a problematic area or even the 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_257,1171830,1177679,place to examine all the researches that relates to the specific question raised in the proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_258,1177679,1181659,Cormack in his book ‘The Research Process in Nursing’ provides a useful overview of 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_259,1181659,1183940,the three key uses of literature review. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_260,1183940,1190429,"It will provide you with a wide range of documentary information on facts, opinion, and comments "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_261,1190429,1194950,"concerning the topic o… to be investigated, help you do to discover whether the topic "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_262,1194950,1199810,"has already been studied, and if so, to what extent your work will be affected, and it "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_263,1199810,1206710,"helps you to decide, which research technique will be most appropriate for your study. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_264,1206710,1211139,"In the early stages, the literature review will consume much of your time and energy. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_265,1211139,1217850,"However, it should be regarded as a continuous process, with new information added as the project proceed. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_266,1217850,1221540,You should take a structural approach to your literature search. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_267,1221540,1223809,"Ask yourself, what information are you after? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_268,1223809,1229990,"If you are going to use words searches of electronic bibliographic sources or the internet, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_269,1229990,1234140,you should list all the possible keywords and synonyms that you consider to be relevant 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_270,1234140,1236440,for you research question. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_271,1236440,1241649,You should also be clear about which timescale you intend to cover in your project and what 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_272,1241649,1245669,the geographic boundaries are that you intend to work within. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_273,1245669,1249970,"Finally, you should be flexible about the range of material that you consider for your "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_274,1249970,1255000,"literature review, especially, if your initial searching fails to uncover a sufficient body "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_275,1255000,1256880,of literature for your study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_276,1256880,1261799,Key questions to ask yourself at this point are- Have I surveyed the described relevant 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_277,1261799,1264700,studies that are related to my research problem? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_278,1264700,1268100,Have I surveyed existing expert opinion on the problem? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_279,1268100,1271759,Have I summarised the existing state of opinion and research on the problem? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_280,1271759,1276390,The next pra… it is methodology to be used for conducting the research. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_281,1276390,1281070,The methodology section should include a discussion of your intended research design. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_282,1281070,1286299,"The sample you will examine, the instrument to be used to conduct the investigation, procedural "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_283,1286299,1291950,"details of collecting your empirical evidences, and the data analysis techniques to be used. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_284,1291950,1296990,"This, this section should be carefully justified by linking it to the aims and objectives of "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_285,1296990,1298820,the proposed study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_286,1298820,1304120,"In empirical research, it is necessary that data be linked to concepts and concepts be "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_287,1304120,1312450,"linked to data and thus, the links between concepts and data be tight, logical and consistent. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_288,1312450,1318039,Well developed and well-stated research question indicate what data will be necessary to answer it.  
Module_20_Research_Proposal_289,1318039,1322070,If the research question do not give clear indication of the data and needed to answer 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_290,1322070,1327460,"them, we will not know how to proceed in the research, when it comes to the data collection "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_291,1327460,1329419,and analysis stage. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_292,1329419,1334230,"Punch in his book, ‘Introduction to Social Research, Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches’ "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_293,1334230,1339590,"say that you develop your research question, ask for que… each question, what data are "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_294,1339590,1341820,needed to answer these questions? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_295,1341820,1346930,With these words Punch lucidly summarises one of the dis… decisive aspect upon which 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_296,1346930,1350610,a research proposal will be judged – the empirical criteria. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_297,1350610,1356169,"When deciding on the research design for your proposed project, you must ensure that it "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_298,1356169,1359380,carefully addresses all of your aims and objectives. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_299,1359380,1366590,"As, reviews, reviewers will need to be reassured that you will be able to answer all the research "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_300,1366590,1371679,questions that you have set yourself in your proposed research investigation. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_301,1371679,1376299,A useful way of establishing this is to link your aims and objective with the proposed 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_302,1376299,1378100,approach and methods. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_303,1378100,1382090,Let's now discuss the concept of research design. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_304,1382090,1386590,The particular research design to be used should be identified as well as how it applies 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_305,1386590,1388030,to the present study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_306,1388030,1392929,"You, therefore need to ensure that choice of approach is justified in this section. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_307,1392929,1398159,"Typically the basic design is fairly clear-cut and fits one of the following models, either "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_308,1398159,1404270,the comparative or the experimental or the cross-se… cross-sectional design or longitudinal 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_309,1404270,1410130,"research design, case study design, action research design, evaluation research design, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_310,1410130,1415130,all these research designs have been dealt in the earlier module as you have seen that. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_311,1415130,1419500,"Now, we come to the next step which is very important is the sampling method. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_312,1419500,1425029,"In your proposal you should indicate in considerable detail, how you will include participant, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_313,1425029,1428639,the sample for investigation in your study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_314,1428639,1431120,You should indicate what the size of the sample will be? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_315,1431120,1436840,"How members will be selected, and what claims you may legitimi… legitimately make about "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_316,1436840,1439040,the representativeness of your sample. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_317,1439040,1444660,"For a quantitative research study you should aim if all, if at all possible to adopt a "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_318,1444660,1450539,random sampling technique or if this is unrealistic a quota sampling method should be used in 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_319,1450539,1453380,an attempt to maximize representativeness. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_320,1453380,1459600,"However, for small scale projects of the type likely to be undertaken by postgraduate students, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_321,1459600,1464850,where you study may will be subject to various resources constraint. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_322,1464850,1471299,It may be legitimate to use another less rigorous sampling methods such as convenience samples. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_323,1471299,1476970,It is more important to complete a project with an unrepresentative sample then abandon 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_324,1476970,1483210,"the study, because it fails to achieve a sample must be used, relevant demographics like gender, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_325,1483210,1488920,"ethnicity, occupation, age, housing, and any other relevant characteristics of the sample "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_326,1488920,1490750,should be described. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_327,1490750,1496580,The legitimate population to which the results of the study may be generalized should be indicated. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_328,1496580,1501140,"For emergent qualitative research design, you are likely to use theoretical sampling "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_329,1501140,1503159,to select research participant. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_330,1503159,1508370,"Where this is the case, you are much more likely to include respondent whose presence "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_331,1508370,1514059,is designed to maximize theoretical development than to achieve representativeness. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_332,1514059,1519269,Your reason for choosing this sample strategy should be indicated and justified within the 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_333,1519269,1525120,section of one research proposal together with an acknowledgement that the sample has 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_334,1525120,1531140,been chosen to generate insight as opposed to definite conclusion about your research 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_335,1531140,1538309,"areas, and the results will be indicated rather than representative of the views of the wider population. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_336,1538309,1542649,"For a further discussion of this point, let’s see the module on sam… sampling technique, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_337,1542649,1548180,which has already been dealt earlier The key question that are to be asked during this 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_338,1548180,1550990,point is- Have I described my sampling plan? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_339,1550990,1554700,Have I described the relevant characteristics at my sample in detail? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_340,1554700,1560269,"If you are using a predominantly quan… quantitative research design, have I identified the population "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_341,1560269,1562779,to which the results of the study may legitimately be generalised? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_342,1562779,1568960,"If you are using a predominantly qualitative research design, have I demonstrated that "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_343,1568960,1575809,my selection at cases is reasonable typically at what might be expected if I had conducted 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_344,1575809,1577789,my research elsewhere? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_345,1577789,1582070,"And now, once you have collected the sample, what instruments to be used? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_346,1582070,1587429,"Whenever possible existing research instruments should be used in your studies since, construction "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_347,1587429,1592639,of ee… even of the most straightforward test or questionnaire for selection of questions 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_348,1592639,1595510,is often very time consuming and difficult. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_349,1595510,1601270,"Furthermore, doing so will enable you to make comparison between you finding and results "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_350,1601270,1605230,from the earlier study from which the research instrument was borrowed. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_351,1605230,1611210,"However, you cannot justify using an existing research instrument if it is not an appropriate "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_352,1611210,1612799,for your purpose. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_353,1612799,1617850,"Even though it may be more convenient, you will therefore need to assess whether existing "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_354,1617850,1620770,instruments are suited to your needs. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_355,1620770,1626129,"In the, in the event that appropriate instruments are not available, the procedure to be followed "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_356,1626129,1631250,in developing your own research instruments to be used in the study should be described 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_357,1631250,1636230,with attention to how validity and reliability will be addressed here. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_358,1636230,1642169,It will be important to indicate within your proposal that you intend to build a pilot 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_359,1642169,1646650,stage into your project or if the research instrument has already been tested for this 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_360,1646650,1653259,"purpose, include a version of these appendices. For example, if you are conducting a survey, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_361,1653259,1657779,you should include a specimen questionnaire or some questions that you consider to be 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_362,1657779,1659740,good illustration of what you will ask. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_363,1659740,1664990,"For a more qualitative research design, you might include and observation se… schedule "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_364,1664990,1668279,or a topic guide for in-depth interview. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_365,1668279,1674360,Key questions to ask yourself at this point are- Is the research design fit for purpose 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_366,1674360,1676950,and does it meet the empirical criterion? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_367,1676950,1683179,"That is, will it yield all the data necessary to answer each of the aims and objective? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_368,1683179,1686249,"Secondly, have I described the instruments to be used? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_369,1686249,1689830,"Thirdly, have I indicated the relevance to the present study? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_370,1689830,1696799,"Then, have I stated, how I will check the reliability and validity off my data collectively instruments? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_371,1696799,1702309,"And finally, have I built a pilot, a piloting the instrument stage into the research design? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_372,1702309,1704809,"Now, procedure and data collection. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_373,1704809,1709289,"Outline the proposed method of research, this should be presented in sufficient detail for "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_374,1709289,1714090,"the reader to know whether the project is realistic, feasible and worthwhile. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_375,1714090,1719370,You will need to describe how you intend to access your target group and con… contact 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_376,1719370,1721040,your research participant. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_377,1721040,1726769,Is your target group one that is typically difficult to involve in research studies of your kind? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_378,1726769,1732330,"If so, what steps will you take to maximize your response rates and minimise bias? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_379,1732330,1735360,What method of data collection will you be using? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_380,1735360,1739950,"For instance, if your proposed study involves the use of a questionnaire, you should indicate "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_381,1739950,1745519,whether you intend to use a self-completion version or implement it in a face to face 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_382,1745519,1747780,situation or via the telephone. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_383,1747780,1752950,"It is important to make your procedure of data collection clear, so that if another "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_384,1752950,1759350,"researcher wants to repeat the study in exactly the same way as in the original, they are "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_385,1759350,1760820,able to replicate your procedures. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_386,1760820,1765860,"Certain procedures may change from those previewed in the proposal as the study is carried out, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_387,1765860,1771120,but a proposal should always aim to have this level of clarity as its goal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_388,1771120,1776529,"Explain, why you think this is the best method for investigating the research problem? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_389,1776529,1781791,A key question to ask yourself at this point is- Have I fully described the procedure to 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_390,1781791,1782990,be followed in the study? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_391,1782990,1784129,What will be done? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_392,1784129,1787419,Where and when and how it will be done? 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_393,1787419,1789960,The next stage is the data analysis stage. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_394,1789960,1796559,"The researcher should indicate how the data to be collected will be organised, interpreted and analysed. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_395,1796559,1801389,You need to show how and why the proposed researcher will yield the information and 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_396,1801389,1805539,insight that will enable you to address your research question. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_397,1805539,1809480,"You therefore, need to justify your choice of methods of data analysis. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_398,1809480,1814919,For a quantitative based study explain which statistical procedures and tests you will 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_399,1814919,1818399,intend to use and why you are choosing to do so. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_400,1818399,1823909,"Similarly, if you are intend to conduct a qualitative research study, then you should "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_401,1823909,1828190,indicate a method of analysis you will use to analyse the data. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_402,1828190,1834120,"Perhaps, you intend to quantify the result obtained from your unstructured interviews? "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_403,1834120,1841940,"If your project is more emergent in nature, you may be proposing to adopt a ground theory approach. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_404,1841940,1844892,"Now, comes the ethical consideration while making a proposal. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_405,1844892,1851240,The review committee will have been alerted to any potential or any actual ethical problems 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_406,1851240,1855150,"likely to arise from your proposed study, while reading the methodology section. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_407,1855150,1861169,The proposal may be reviewed by a committee whose primary objective is to assess the scientific 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_408,1861169,1866249,"method of a study, but also they will be aware of ethical issues. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_409,1866249,1871409,It is important that you anticipate gaining written consent from adults or parents or 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_410,1871409,1875770,guardians when members of your target group cannot themselves give approval. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_411,1875770,1880559,Ethical matters may also be relevant to protect these research partipi… participants from 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_412,1880559,1883240,any negative consequences of your study. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_413,1883240,1888110,"However, you will also need to demonstrate to the review committee that you have taken "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_414,1888110,1894009,adequate steps to ensure that both yourself and others associated with your intended projects 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_415,1894009,1899740,"are protected from harm, particularly if the research situation is one that has the potential "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_416,1899740,1902780,to place people in position of danger. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_417,1902780,1907500,For a data protection purpose you will also need to give due regard to how you intend 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_418,1907500,1909910,to store your data security. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_419,1909910,1915619,"At some point in the proposal, it is necessary to indicate clearly what you regarded as the "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_420,1915619,1920510,major ethical issues of the project and to state clearly how these will be handled. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_421,1920510,1925230,"Alternatively, you may state that the proposal raises no ethical issues. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_422,1925230,1930570,"In order to complete this section effectively and convincingly, you should pay close attention "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_423,1930570,1936039,to the ethical guidelines and are set out in the codes of conduct that may academic 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_424,1936039,1940080,or professional organisation have developed. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_425,1940080,1944880,"Now, time scale is another important aspect that you need to keep in mind while drafting a proposal. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_426,1944880,1949899,The amount of time you need to devote to your study should be set out in the proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_427,1949899,1956509,It may be that this is a proposal for a full time commitment or perhaps for only a few hours in a week. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_428,1956509,1961700,"But whichever is the case, the research proposal must specify the amount of time involved. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_429,1961700,1966019,The review committee will need to know how long the project will take when considering 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_430,1966019,1972559,"whether to fund it or not, and then you also need to discuss the facilities and resources available. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_431,1972559,1977639,Describing particular form of expertise or backup facilities can strengthen a proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_432,1977639,1982039,Good computer and library facilities fall into this category. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_433,1982039,1986869,Where established network are integral to a project or cooperation has been obtained 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_434,1986869,1993230,"from a particular agency or instruction, institutions, some indications of this, like letter of agreement "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_435,1993230,1996340,may be included as a helpful appendix. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_436,1996340,2002889,"Now budget, finally, we come to the most important aspect of its forming a budget. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_437,2002889,2007580,Preparing a research budget is as much as skill as preparing other parts of the proposal. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_438,2007580,2012910,Part of the skill lies in locating the other people who knows the price of all appropriate 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_439,2012910,2017210,"commodities, staff time, tape recorders, photocopying, travel cost, and so on. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_440,2017210,2024220,Preparing a budget means translating the timescale and plan of work into financial terms. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_441,2024220,2030179,"In preparing a budget use a checklist to include main heading such as research salaries, data "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_442,2030179,2035850,"collection costs, purchase of equipment and other materials printing, travelling, expense, "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_443,2035850,2039649,"stationery, and postage data analysis expenses, etcetera. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_444,2039649,2042470,Once you have drafted your budget and other things. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_445,2042470,2047039,"Now, let's have a checklist which wi… will be very helpful in pre-submission. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_446,2047039,2051280,"It is likely that a research proposal will go through many drafts, indeed there would "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_447,2051280,2054050,be major cause for concern if it did not. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_448,2054050,2058800,"There are number of things to be achieved in reviewing a proposal, not least considering "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_449,2058800,2065250,"its physical presentation, legibility, lucidity, and clarity of the presentations are all important. "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_450,2065250,2071410,"While readers of a proposal will not be evaluating its presentation, the relatively small amount "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_451,2071410,2078310,of time it takes to ensure a layout that is easily followed will be time well spent. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_452,2078310,2083530,Check carefully that the proposal meets all the criteria set by review committee. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_453,2083530,2088530,Once you have checked all your list your proposal is set for submission. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_454,2088530,2095150,"So, What we have learnt in this that it has reviewed the process of constructing a research "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_455,2095150,2099840,"proposal, setting out the main point that need to be considered in producing a professional "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_456,2099840,2101680,and convincing document. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_457,2101680,2109240,As we have seen in any proposal it is paramount important that the research that is in envisaged 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_458,2109240,2115970,is clearly articulated and is of value of the body looking to support your research. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_459,2115970,2122030,"In assessing your proposal, a reviewer will also be taking in to see that you proposed "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_460,2122030,2124950,study is a feasible one. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_461,2124950,2129192,"As well as capturing a reviewer imagination with the subject of your research, you will "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_462,2129192,2134190,have to satisfy the reviewer that you are in a position to carry the research out to 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_463,2134190,2135560,a higher standard. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_464,2135560,2140071,Having a bright idea is the starting point from which you have to construct a comp… 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_465,2140071,2147310,compelling case that your research is not only interesting bo… but also capable of execution. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_466,2147310,2152120,"Of course, all reviewers will have their own set of criteria by which they will judge the "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_467,2152120,2157370,proposal that comes before them unfortunately there is no easily applied formula that can 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_468,2157370,2161660,be applied to all research proposal that can guarantee success. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_469,2161660,2166960,"However, the more consideration that you have been able to give to the research you planned "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_470,2166960,2172470,to carry out reflecting on the outline element that have been discussed in this module. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_471,2172470,2179050,The more likely is that you will be able to produce a proposal that stands up to keen scrutiny. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_472,2179050,2183860,"So, once you have learnt this and I think you will be able to formulate a very beautiful "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_473,2183860,2190210,project and you should thank MOOCs for giving you this opportunity to draft a proposal and 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_474,2190210,2194430,"to come up with a, with the research scheme that can help you in a proposal development "
Module_20_Research_Proposal_475,2194430,2198360,because wi… this is the most important element for any research. 
Module_20_Research_Proposal_476,2198360,2198780,Thank you. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_0,33140,36320,"Dear students, I am Doctor Manish Singh. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_1,36320,42050,"I am from Doctor Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_2,42050,53210,"Today, I will discuss a module on legal research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_3,53210,54770,What is legal research? 
Module_2_Legal_Research_4,54770,61370,"The idea of research puzzles us and seems to be an insurmountable task at times, but "
Module_2_Legal_Research_5,61370,64510,the reality is that we do it all the time. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_6,64510,67990,It’s going on around us every day. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_7,67990,74500,"Many of us will at some point participate in some or the other enquiry, may it be about "
Module_2_Legal_Research_8,74500,82520,"a recipe, a preferred brand of clothes or even as to whom one plans to vote in the elections. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_9,82520,88140,Even when some may choose not to participate in the research still results outcome do have 
Module_2_Legal_Research_10,88140,91120,an impact indirectly upon people. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_11,91120,96270,"Policy decisions, laws are based on research findings. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_12,96270,101920,"The research is done in the universities, policy think tanks who suggest the findings "
Module_2_Legal_Research_13,101920,107350,based on a systematic process and informs the policy makers about the desirable changes. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_14,107350,116079,"Hence, it is out of incredible importance to people, hence, it is of incredible importance to people.  "
Module_2_Legal_Research_15,116079,123159,"It can be easily imagined that research touches every area be it law, be it marketing, technology, "
Module_2_Legal_Research_16,123159,127340,be it even food habits. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_17,127340,134020,The learning outcome of this module are that the module has a primary objective of reducing 
Module_2_Legal_Research_18,134020,140860,"an, the audience to a broad overview what, how and why of legal research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_19,140860,145910,That highlights some characteristics with an intention of introducing legal research 
Module_2_Legal_Research_20,145910,151970,to non-legal researchers and intends to serve as a first step towards an enduring enterprise 
Module_2_Legal_Research_21,151970,158280,"that is legal research which is rewarding, fulfilling and beneficial not only for the "
Module_2_Legal_Research_22,158280,161670,"researcher, but even the society at large. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_23,161670,171239,"In this module, we shall primarily cover the meaning of research, the purpose of research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_24,171239,173180,What is legal research? 
Module_2_Legal_Research_25,173180,178900,"The purpose of legal research, broad nature of legal research, various kinds of legal "
Module_2_Legal_Research_26,178900,185980,"research, other major methods of legal research, the process of legal research, sources of "
Module_2_Legal_Research_27,185980,192650,information and the major problems in legal research and finally we shall summarize what 
Module_2_Legal_Research_28,192650,196410,we have learnt so far. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_29,196410,199310,Starting with the meaning of research. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_30,199310,204340,A term can be best understood with reference to the purpose it seeks to achieve. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_31,204340,209670,The purpose of research is either to know about or to contribute something new to the 
Module_2_Legal_Research_32,209670,212010,existing state of knowledge. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_33,212010,217599,The former can be described as the ‘disinterested search for knowledge and understanding for 
Module_2_Legal_Research_34,217599,225190,"its own sake’, while the latter is an application based approach to the problems in the real world. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_35,225190,232709,The prefix re before research signifies a continuum which verifies or supplements existing knowledge. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_36,232709,238410,"It involves a systematic, careful, diligent and thorough investigation into a specific "
Module_2_Legal_Research_37,238410,244200,question with a primary objective of contributing to the existing knowledge. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_38,244200,250890,"A directionless, unspecific, unsystematic and mere surface brushing would give us results "
Module_2_Legal_Research_39,250890,255269,that cannot reveal realistic outcomes. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_40,255269,257680,What is the purpose of research? 
Module_2_Legal_Research_41,257680,263260,Apart from general understanding that is basic research or to find something new as applied 
Module_2_Legal_Research_42,263260,268360,research in broader terms or research fulfils following objectives. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_43,268360,272190,"First, contribute to existing knowledge and a discipline. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_44,272190,279070,"Secondly, to inform policy making and thirdly to address a specific issue or question. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_45,279070,286970,"We will start with describing the first point, that is to contribute to existing knowledge "
Module_2_Legal_Research_46,286970,289800,"in a discipline for example, law. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_47,289800,294020,Research can give us new set of perspectives at looking at things. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_48,294020,301330,"For example, historical events are continuously revised and reviewed on the basis of research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_49,301330,307540,"Therefore, the version of history might not be the same for two different set of generations. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_50,307540,312740,"Given that, many of us would believe them to be unchangeable given their facts, but "
Module_2_Legal_Research_51,312740,317200,still it can be argued that they can be viewed from a different lens. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_52,317200,321860,This had a positive impact on existing state of knowledge in a particular discipline in 
Module_2_Legal_Research_53,321860,325130,the sense that it expands its horizons. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_54,325130,328510,"Second, to inform policy making. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_55,328510,334030,"For example, policy making as to crime, as to housing policy, etcetera. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_56,334030,336750,Research also informs policy questions. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_57,336750,343670,"For example, research can be used to address socio-economic issues, say education as to "
Module_2_Legal_Research_58,343670,349300,how it can be given a direction as to ensure growth in a nation or say as to how to best 
Module_2_Legal_Research_59,349300,354979,avoid food wastage and can there be a space for law to tackle these issues. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_60,354979,361870,These kinds of researches inform policy making which ultimately reflects in the law and decision making. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_61,361870,365910,"Thirdly, to address a specific issue or question. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_62,365910,369760,"Say for example, substance abuse in campus. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_63,369760,374349,Research findings are also used to answer a specific issue at hand. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_64,374349,380029,It is stemmed from the concerns that the conventional researchers were not having much impact and 
Module_2_Legal_Research_65,380029,385250,thereby new approaches that were seen as being more relevant and practical in the real world 
Module_2_Legal_Research_66,385250,387340,settings were developed. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_67,387340,393330,"It can be action research which is both diagnose a specific issue and attempt to solve it, "
Module_2_Legal_Research_68,393330,396530,thereby to improve practice in some way. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_69,396530,401760,Also it may be evaluation which assesses the existing state of affairs in an era wherein 
Module_2_Legal_Research_70,401760,407430,"the accountability has increased, that requires a constant reassessment about the worth or "
Module_2_Legal_Research_71,407430,412570,usefulness of a particular service policy or other intervention. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_72,412570,413570,Describing legal research. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_73,413570,419209,Taking a cue from the discussion above legal research can be understood as a systematic 
Module_2_Legal_Research_74,419209,425350,"finding or ascertainment of law on an identified topic or in the given area, as well as an "
Module_2_Legal_Research_75,425350,430770,enquiry into law with a view of making advancement in the science of law. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_76,430770,435590,This is not an easy task to find the law in a vast mass of statutes which are constantly 
Module_2_Legal_Research_77,435590,442260,"amended and supplemented by rules, regulations, orders, directives, ordinances, judgement "
Module_2_Legal_Research_78,442260,444839,of courts and bylaws. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_79,444839,449770,Also for making advancement in the science of law requires a systematic probe into the 
Module_2_Legal_Research_80,449770,453060,underlying principle of and reasons for law. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_81,453060,455560,"Thus, legal research has a broad ambit to it. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_82,455560,464150,"It has to be continuously done by legislators, judges, lawyers, law students and law teachers. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_83,464150,468290,"Now, what is the purpose of research? "
Module_2_Legal_Research_84,468290,470330,Law does not sit in a vacuum. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_85,470330,474120,"Instead, it operates in a complex social context. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_86,474120,479640,It reflects attitudes and behavioural norms and also control and mould them. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_87,479640,484110,"However, as these norms are al… also temporal spatial. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_88,484110,489880,"However, as these norms are also temporal spatial that is changing with time and space. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_89,489880,496800,"It is desires that law has to adapt and be dynamic in order to cope with the changes, "
Module_2_Legal_Research_90,496800,503019,thereby legal research becomes essential for ascertainment of law to point out ambiguities 
Module_2_Legal_Research_91,503019,509310,"and weaknesses of law, to critically examine the laws in order to ensure coherence, consistency "
Module_2_Legal_Research_92,509310,515000,and stability of law and its underlying policy to conduct a social audit of the law and to 
Module_2_Legal_Research_93,515000,517120,suggest reforms in the law. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_94,517120,519870,Taking them one by one. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_95,519870,526839,"First, ascertaining the law, in a complex mass of legal statutes and coupled with allied "
Module_2_Legal_Research_96,526839,531550,legal material it is not always easy to find the law on a particular point. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_97,531550,538070,They are scattered and a single issue may involve application of various laws. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_98,538070,540490,Judicial pronouncements adds to the complexity. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_99,540490,545370,"A researcher needs to locate, analyse and understand these pronouncements. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_100,545370,552640,"So, the process involves an intensive analysis of legal instruments and judicial pronouncements. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_101,552640,556130,"Now, highlighting the ambiguities and gaps. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_102,556130,562500,A law is not designed to address every contingency that might arise in future because it is the 
Module_2_Legal_Research_103,562500,568130,"nature of law that it is reactive, it answers to problems which had arisen and seldom is "
Module_2_Legal_Research_104,568130,570230,it that it is proactive. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_105,570230,575660,"Secondly, even in the physiology of provision may not fit with the legislative intent or "
Module_2_Legal_Research_106,575660,579240,may not match with other provisions of the act. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_107,579240,582730,Research highlights these gaps and inbuilt ambiguities. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_108,582730,590360,"Thirdly, to determine coherence, stability and consistency via a process of critical "
Module_2_Legal_Research_109,590360,591630,evaluation of the law. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_110,591630,597380,"A researcher can exhibit the consistency, coherence and stability in the law. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_111,597380,602630,"This helps in future designing and development of law, legal provision or doctrine, as the "
Module_2_Legal_Research_112,602630,604410,case may be. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_113,604410,607680,"Fourth, social auditing of law. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_114,607680,613520,It is a pre-legislative step then in order to understand and appreciate the social factors 
Module_2_Legal_Research_115,613520,616930,that had an impact on the making of law. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_116,616930,623280,It enables one to know the stakes the law intends to protect or change and reasons for the same. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_117,623280,629330,Such an audit helps to identify gap if any between the legal ideal and the social reality 
Module_2_Legal_Research_118,629330,632340,and to know the reasons responsible thereof. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_119,632340,635610,It also enables us to predict the future of law. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_120,635610,639020,"Now, fifthly, suggesting reforms. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_121,639020,643490,In the light of the research reforms can be proposed in precise terms. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_122,643490,649950,"These outcomes can be on the basis of an analytical, historical and comparative research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_123,649950,654020,"Now, what are the broad nature of the legal research? "
Module_2_Legal_Research_124,654020,659440,On the basis of data collection and analysis two broad categories can be used to describe 
Module_2_Legal_Research_125,659440,661050,different approaches. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_126,661050,666380,"First, the quantitative legal research and secondly, the qualitative legal research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_127,666380,671200,"First, we will discuss the quantitative legal research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_128,671200,676800,"The quantitative research is characterized with surveys, structured interviews, experiments, "
Module_2_Legal_Research_129,676800,679900,tests as tools for data collection. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_130,679900,684310,It produces data which can be made subject to statistical analysis. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_131,684310,687510,"So, the findings can be presented in numerical forms. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_132,687510,693370,"For example, a questionnaire asked respondents to tick the appropriate box in order to answer "
Module_2_Legal_Research_133,693370,698490,the question as to whether they agree or disagree with the particular proposition. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_134,698490,703670,This gives an opportunity to the researcher to quantify the data and calculate how many 
Module_2_Legal_Research_135,703670,706100,people made a particular point. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_136,706100,713280,"Now, coming to qualitative legal research, participant observation and structured interviews "
Module_2_Legal_Research_137,713280,715722,or life histories are some of the qualitative research methods. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_138,715722,720780,The outcome is presented in the form of descriptions. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_139,720780,725580,The reason it become important was that the feeling that quantitative research does not 
Module_2_Legal_Research_140,725580,731020,take into account the differences between people and the objects of natural science. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_141,731020,735960,It seems to be artificial and distant from everyday life that the findings might not 
Module_2_Legal_Research_142,735960,737950,represent the reality. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_143,737950,743440,These led many researchers to adopt more qualitative methods which allow researchers to get closer 
Module_2_Legal_Research_144,743440,747440,to the people they are investigating. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_145,747440,750350,What are the different kinds of legal research? 
Module_2_Legal_Research_146,750350,755740,The basic type of research can be broadly classified in various subsets wherein they 
Module_2_Legal_Research_147,755740,759600,can be understood in comparison with another kind of research. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_148,759600,766250,"Those are descriptive and analytical legal research, applied and pure legal research, "
Module_2_Legal_Research_149,766250,772480,"quantitative and qualitative legal research, conceptual and empirical legal research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_150,772480,777920,"First, discussing the descriptive and analytical legal research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_151,777920,782160,The former describe the state of affairs as it exits. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_152,782160,787870,"It describes the phenomena, reporting what has happened and what is happening without "
Module_2_Legal_Research_153,787870,790870,going into the reason or cause for the same. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_154,790870,796300,"The tools used are surveys, comparative and core… correlational method. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_155,796300,802920,"The tools used are surveys, comparative and correlational methods and fact finding enquiries, "
Module_2_Legal_Research_156,802920,806980,but it does not establish any relationship between the variables. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_157,806980,812040,"The analytical research however, uses the fact and information available to make a critical "
Module_2_Legal_Research_158,812040,813670,evaluation. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_159,813670,818060,"Second, applied and pure legal research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_160,818060,823490,"The aim of the former is to find a solution to a present, practical problem at hand. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_161,823490,826030,Researchers put it in a practical context. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_162,826030,831270,The later focuses on generalisation and formulation of a theory. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_163,831270,835480,Its aim is to broaden the understanding of a particular field of investigation. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_164,835480,839500,The researcher does not focus upon the practical utility of the results. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_165,839500,845310,In case of quantitative and qualitative legal research. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_166,845310,850820,"As mentioned, the former is about quantity or amount that is what can be expressed in "
Module_2_Legal_Research_167,850820,852870,numerical form of results. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_168,852870,858270,"The later, however, aims at garnishing views and opinions to give outcomes. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_169,858270,865420,It relies on reasons behind a particular behavioural aspect. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_170,865420,868400,"The fourth, conceptual and empirical legal research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_171,868400,873000,The conceptual research is related with an abstract notion on an idea. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_172,873000,877930,Generally resorted to by the philosophers and thinkers to develop new concepts or reinterpret 
Module_2_Legal_Research_173,877930,879790,the existing concepts. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_174,879790,883920,"The later, however, relies upon experience and observation alone. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_175,883920,892070,It is databased coming up with results that can be verified by observations or experiments. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_176,892070,894190,What are the major kind of legal research? 
Module_2_Legal_Research_177,894190,901931,"The other major methods used in legal research are doctrinal legal research, non-doctrinal "
Module_2_Legal_Research_178,901931,904920,"legal research, comparative legal research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_179,904920,911830,"First, we will discuss what is meant by doctrinal legal research. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_180,911830,916839,The central question of enquiry here is what is the law on a particular issue. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_181,916839,922830,It is concerned with finding the law vigorously analysing it and coming up with a logical 
Module_2_Legal_Research_182,922830,924510,reasoning behind it. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_183,924510,930700,"Therefore, it immensely contribute to the continuity, consistency and certainty of law. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_184,930700,936640,The basic material can be found in the statutory material that is primary sources as well in 
Module_2_Legal_Research_185,936640,938580,the secondary material. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_186,938580,944490,"However, the research has its own limitations it is subjective that is limited to the perception "
Module_2_Legal_Research_187,944490,949760,of the researcher away from the actual working of the law devoid of factors that led outside 
Module_2_Legal_Research_188,949760,955680,the periphery of law and fails to focus on the actual practice of the courts. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_189,955680,960900,"Now, what is non-doctrinal legal research? "
Module_2_Legal_Research_190,960900,964210,Non-doctrinal legal research is also known as socio-legal research. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_191,964210,969050,It leads into how the law and legal institutions moulds and affect the society. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_192,969050,975080,It employs methods taken from other disciplines in order to generate an empirical data to 
Module_2_Legal_Research_193,975080,976860,answer the questions. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_194,976860,981310,It can either be answering a problem like to find the gap between idealism and social 
Module_2_Legal_Research_195,981310,987960,"reality, could be tracing the results of legal decisions, can also assess impact of non-legal "
Module_2_Legal_Research_196,987960,992200,factors upon legal processes or decisions or may be an reform-based approach. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_197,992200,999670,"It is about viewing law from the perspective of a different discipline it, to keep it organic "
Module_2_Legal_Research_198,999670,1003820,"and growing, that is to put things in a context. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_199,1003820,1008850,Being empirical it is vital and valuable in revealing and expanding the legal practice 
Module_2_Legal_Research_200,1008850,1015450,"and procedures and their impact on range of social institutions like family, businesses, "
Module_2_Legal_Research_201,1015450,1018090,"citizens, consumers. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_202,1018090,1022860,"Thirdly, what is comparative legal research? "
Module_2_Legal_Research_203,1022860,1029740,"Comparative legal research involves a comparison of legal doctrines, legislations via the foreign laws.  "
Module_2_Legal_Research_204,1029740,1035699,"It highlights the cultural and social character of law and how does it acts in different settings, "
Module_2_Legal_Research_205,1035699,1040189,so it is useful in developing and amending and modifying the law. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_206,1040189,1044839,But a cautious approach has to be taken in blindly accepting the law of another socio 
Module_2_Legal_Research_207,1044839,1051919,setting as an ideal because it might not act in the same manner in a different setting. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_208,1051919,1054750,What are the sources of information? 
Module_2_Legal_Research_209,1054750,1060650,The various sources of information can be classified into primary and secondary sources. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_210,1060650,1065550,Primary source is that source that contain authoritative records of law made by law making 
Module_2_Legal_Research_211,1065550,1068720,bodies is a primary source. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_212,1068720,1075660,"They can be legislation, rules, regulations, orders, bylaws by delegated legis, authorities "
Module_2_Legal_Research_213,1075660,1080090,and the authoritative decisions of the courts. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_214,1080090,1082090,Source of information. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_215,1082090,1087150,The secondary sources are the one that refer and relate to the law while not being themselves 
Module_2_Legal_Research_216,1087150,1088440,primary sources. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_217,1088440,1095410,"For example, legal commentaries, abstracts, dictionaries, encyclopaedia and index. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_218,1095410,1097929,What are the processes of a legal research? 
Module_2_Legal_Research_219,1097929,1103300,Research is a process involving backward and forward movement between different stages 
Module_2_Legal_Research_220,1103300,1106180,so they cannot be as neatly separated. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_221,1106180,1112350,"Nevertheless, they can be divided into the following for understanding the different stages. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_222,1112350,1117710,"Choosing a focal point of research, review of literature, formulation of hypothesis, "
Module_2_Legal_Research_223,1117710,1125770,"research design, data collection, data analysis, interpretation of data and finally the report. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_224,1125770,1130220,"Now, we shall discuss these points. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_225,1130220,1135840,"Choosing a focal point of research, identifying and formulating a legal problem is the first "
Module_2_Legal_Research_226,1135840,1137700,step in the process. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_227,1137700,1143480,If ill-defined and not properly formulated researcher is bound to lose interest in the research. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_228,1143480,1148850,"The researcher has to have a precise goal in sight, for that purpose it is necessary "
Module_2_Legal_Research_229,1148850,1154340,"for the researcher to identify an area of general interest from the field, an area of "
Module_2_Legal_Research_230,1154340,1158720,specific interest and within that area of specific interest a particular aspect that 
Module_2_Legal_Research_231,1158720,1165250,"he would like to enquire into, that would signify the focus and direction of his enquiry "
Module_2_Legal_Research_232,1165250,1170150,"that has to be based on a study done from the secondary sources like a commentary, a "
Module_2_Legal_Research_233,1170150,1174860,scholarly article like Blackstone’s commentaries on the laws of England. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_234,1174860,1180000,"Secondary sources would point a researcher to the primary source of the law, namely legislative "
Module_2_Legal_Research_235,1180000,1183740,tax and judicial decisions. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_236,1183740,1185570,Second comes the review of literature. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_237,1185570,1191950,It is necessary because it would make the result to be both valued and valuable. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_238,1191950,1197650,It is a survey of the existing related works in order to find out as to what has already 
Module_2_Legal_Research_239,1197650,1200270,been discussed on the particular aspect. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_240,1200270,1204800,It will also give an understanding as to what has not been discussed. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_241,1204800,1210540,"The researcher’s aim is to contribute something new to the existing state of knowledge, so "
Module_2_Legal_Research_242,1210540,1213380,"therefore, he has to choose from the later area. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_243,1213380,1218870,This also justifies his research and makes it an original contribution. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_244,1218870,1224650,It also helps in avoiding the possible pitfalls and informs areas that might have been neglected 
Module_2_Legal_Research_245,1224650,1227050,in the research questions. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_246,1227050,1230650,Third comes the formulation of hypothesis. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_247,1230650,1236080,On the basis of an extensive literature survey a researcher might rephrase or reformulate 
Module_2_Legal_Research_248,1236080,1241559,"the problem that can be depending upon the nature of research, can be in the form of "
Module_2_Legal_Research_249,1241559,1247580,"a mere statement or a proposition indicating relationship between variables, the validity "
Module_2_Legal_Research_250,1247580,1249720,of which is not known. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_251,1249720,1252220,Such propositions are known as hypothesis. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_252,1252220,1258540,"So, it is a tentative statement the validity or invalidity of which has yet to be tested "
Module_2_Legal_Research_253,1258540,1260680,on the basis of research. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_254,1260680,1266549,"The manner in which it is formulated gives a hint of methods required, kind of data needed, "
Module_2_Legal_Research_255,1266549,1271000,and the method of analysis required for the research. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_256,1271000,1273470,Then comes the research design. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_257,1273470,1277010,Research design signifies the structure of the research. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_258,1277010,1282450,"It is characterized by a logical systematic planning of the research, a blueprint. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_259,1282450,1287600,Though it may be tentative as the researcher cannot foresee all the contingencies that 
Module_2_Legal_Research_260,1287600,1293600,might arise and thus he can adapt as required which would increase the efficiency and reliability 
Module_2_Legal_Research_261,1293600,1297390,of his findings. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_262,1297390,1303290,"After this comes data collection, data collection involves decision making as to the method "
Module_2_Legal_Research_263,1303290,1308530,to be employ to collect the data that determines the fate of the research. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_264,1308530,1313830,For determining the appropriate method a researcher has to keep in mind the objectives of the 
Module_2_Legal_Research_265,1313830,1316500,research and the scope of the enquiry. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_266,1316500,1319050,Data may be primary or secondary. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_267,1319050,1322010,Data collected by primary source is primary. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_268,1322010,1327040,While one collected from other agency or available in some published form is secondary. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_269,1327040,1332520,A data has to be relevant and authoritative that would primarily depend upon the scope 
Module_2_Legal_Research_270,1332520,1336770,and focus of the research question. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_271,1336770,1340830,After collecting data we analyse the data. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_272,1340830,1344870,"Therefore, the next task after data collection is analysis. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_273,1344870,1350790,The raw data has to be put it to analysis so as to reflect the direction and trend. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_274,1350790,1352680,Analysis happens before interpretation. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_275,1352680,1357980,There is no clear cut demarcation between the two as analysis is not complete without 
Module_2_Legal_Research_276,1357980,1361620,interpretation and interpretation cannot precede analysis. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_277,1361620,1365120,They are thus interdependent. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_278,1365120,1376630,"Analysis involves processes like classification and categorization, coding and tabulation. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_279,1376630,1380720,In a legal research cases are also required to be analysed. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_280,1380720,1385460,"However, with the caution the two different set of facts can lead to different outcomes "
Module_2_Legal_Research_281,1385460,1390240,or may be for the same reason that an earlier case law can be distinguished on the basis 
Module_2_Legal_Research_282,1390240,1392210,of question of law raised. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_283,1392210,1398929,It is the drawing inferences from the collected data that interpretation is done. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_284,1398929,1402429,Interpretation can be inductive or deductive. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_285,1402429,1406410,Inductive is inference from particular propositions to general propositions. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_286,1406410,1412700,While deductive is inferences from general propositions to particular propositions. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_287,1412700,1418670,The interpretation give the broader meaning to research findings and as well trigger new researchers. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_288,1418670,1424120,"However, caution must be exercised in interpreting the data. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_289,1424120,1426460,It needs to be impartial and objective. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_290,1426460,1433390,A wrong interpretation can lead to inaccurate and misleading conclusions. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_291,1433390,1436250,After interpretation comes the report. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_292,1436250,1439960,"Thus, the last phase is report writing. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_293,1439960,1445890,"Though this, through this the researcher communicates his work to the audience. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_294,1445890,1451780,"Report contains significant facts, those are the problem, method used and the findings "
Module_2_Legal_Research_295,1451780,1453300,arrived at by the researcher. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_296,1453300,1460300,It has to be original and with precise clarity in communicating the results. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_297,1460300,1463420,What are the major problems in legal research? 
Module_2_Legal_Research_298,1463420,1468380,The major problems while undertaking a legal research are as follows. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_299,1468380,1471440,"First, cultural problems. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_300,1471440,1474820,"Secondly, structural and procedural problems. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_301,1474820,1478840,"For example, unsympathetic attitude of authorities. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_302,1478840,1481299,"Thirdly, lack of resources. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_303,1481299,1487530,"For example, access to money, access to the information, etcetera. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_304,1487530,1494760,"Incompetence, for example, inadequate planning and lack of networking and forums. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_305,1494760,1501260,"Thus, we can summarize what we have learnt so far. "
Module_2_Legal_Research_306,1501260,1507110,Legal research is a systematic understanding of the law with a view of its advancement. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_307,1507110,1512360,The purposes of the same are very important to the people and society because law acts 
Module_2_Legal_Research_308,1512360,1516670,within the society and the both had an impact on each other. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_309,1516670,1519650,Every kind of research method had its own value. 
Module_2_Legal_Research_310,1519650,1525990,"However, while undertaking a research a researcher might face some hurdles, but they can be avoided "
Module_2_Legal_Research_311,1525990,1528210,by proper planning of the research process. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_0,510,1510,Hello everyone. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_1,1510,3610,Welcome back to the Research meth… 
Module_33_Report_Writing_2,3610,4859,Methodology modules. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_3,4859,8680,And today we have reached to the last module that is Report Writing. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_4,8680,13390,"So, this is the most important aspect because this is the most important thing that you "
Module_33_Report_Writing_5,13390,15370,do about your research. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_6,15370,17369,"As you know, I am Doctor Ritu Sharma. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_7,17369,19470,We have done various modules together. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_8,19470,24840,"Today, I am going to discuss with you the module on Report Writing. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_9,24840,30480,"In this, I am going to talk about the ways in which research writing links theory with practice. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_10,30480,36510,"Then we are going to see the aims of research writing, and then will sentis… sensitize "
Module_33_Report_Writing_11,36510,42039,the readers to the need to communicate and their research with their audience and then 
Module_33_Report_Writing_12,42039,47379,to provide readers with the framework within which they can write up their research reports. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_13,47379,52449,"Finally, to provide a practical guidance of the management of the writing process and "
Module_33_Report_Writing_14,52449,54979,enable a good reference and citation practice. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_15,54979,61559,The culmination of a research project arrives when all the hard work is put to paper and 
Module_33_Report_Writing_16,61559,65780,the fruits of our labor are shared with a wider audience. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_17,65780,71830,"This means writang… writing up for research in a way that presents not just our findings, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_18,71830,75510,but the process through which we arrive at these findings. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_19,75510,82951,"It demands an honesty about our research design and our perspective, so that others can understand "
Module_33_Report_Writing_20,82951,89460,"not just the research we have produced, but something about the way in which we have produced it  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_21,89460,96580,"The foundation for this approach writing is that research projects do not exist in isolation, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_22,96580,101950,but contribute to a wider body of knowledge that is constantly developing. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_23,101950,108860,"In exploring the writer write-up process, it is useful to consider Denscombe’s view "
Module_33_Report_Writing_24,108860,115340,that there are some common themes and shared concerns that underline formal reports of 
Module_33_Report_Writing_25,115340,119690,research across the spectrum of approaches within the social sciences. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_26,119690,126420,"There is some general consensus that when writing up research, the aim is to explain "
Module_33_Report_Writing_27,126420,132200,"the purpose of the research, describe how the research was done, present the findings "
Module_33_Report_Writing_28,132200,138389,"from the research, discuss and analyze the findings, and reach the conclusions. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_29,138389,145879,These five aims form a useful basis upon which to approach the writing of a research project. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_30,145879,153410,"As Denscombe suggests, this appears to be one area, at least, where there I agree of "
Module_33_Report_Writing_31,153410,155109,consensus among researchers. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_32,155109,162390,Qualitative and quantitative researchers may disagree on the precise layout or presentation 
Module_33_Report_Writing_33,162390,169130,"of reports, and we shall acknowledge this, but for our purpose, the mutual aims of writing "
Module_33_Report_Writing_34,169130,173450,up provide a useful focus for our discussion. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_35,173450,179500,Addressing the research question with your data is the first thing that we are going to discuss.  
Module_33_Report_Writing_36,179500,185120,"When presenting the outcome of our research, it is important to return to the very beginning "
Module_33_Report_Writing_37,185120,189200,and ask ourselves what was the purpose of this research? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_38,189200,195970,"The research process can be lengthy, and time spent in the field, or mulling over the reams "
Module_33_Report_Writing_39,195970,202300,"data, can make the point of origin of our research seems like a dim and distant memory. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_40,202300,208190,"So, when it comes to writing up, the temptation can be to see the light at the end of the "
Module_33_Report_Writing_41,208190,213200,tunnel and simply focus on bringing the research to a close. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_42,213200,218980,"But it is important to remind ourselves of the aims and objective of a research, since "
Module_33_Report_Writing_43,218980,222939,it is these that we need to address in writing. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_44,222939,228689,"Research, by its nature, can generate lots of interesting observations. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_45,228689,235780,"As we journey through the process, a perception of, and ideas about our research area may "
Module_33_Report_Writing_46,235780,241029,"change, leading us to consider new possibilities for future research perhaps. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_47,241029,248290,"It is easy to see how, by becoming distracted by alternative ideas presented by our data, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_48,248290,252099,we may forget what our original stance was. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_49,252099,258910,"These new ideas are every bit as important as our original ideas, as they represent an "
Module_33_Report_Writing_50,258910,260190,advancement in knowledge. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_51,260190,266780,"But we must remember that at some point, some time ago, we came up with the research question "
Module_33_Report_Writing_52,266780,269250,that we set out to address. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_53,269250,275200,Enforcing the research question upon our write-up may appear to be a restrictive measure. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_54,275200,279620,What if the data present issue outside the research question? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_55,279620,285900,"Well what we are suggesting is not that these issues are ignored, but that the research "
Module_33_Report_Writing_56,285900,289780,question should be used to guide the primary focus of a writing. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_57,289780,296090,One of the greatest barriers researcher face when it comes to writing up is tackling the 
Module_33_Report_Writing_58,296090,300350,"program of what to write about, and how to organize it. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_59,300350,306650,"The research question can be used as guidance here, since it provides us with the framework "
Module_33_Report_Writing_60,306650,310530,within which we can organize the data. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_61,310530,316270,"Writing strategies – Of all the stages of the research process, the one that arguably "
Module_33_Report_Writing_62,316270,323070,"plagues researcher the most is writing up, yet writing is arguably a skill which most "
Module_33_Report_Writing_63,323070,326450,of us acquire before becoming researcher. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_64,326450,332950,"It makes use of our experiences of expressing our ideas by putting pen to paper, something "
Module_33_Report_Writing_65,332950,337290,that we start to learn from a very early age. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_66,337290,343860,"Perhaps, this explains why it is an activity that is regarded as undeserving the same degree "
Module_33_Report_Writing_67,343860,346830,"of attention as, say, statistical analysis. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_68,346830,354040,"They, there certainly appears to be a lack of attention to the process of writing in the literature. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_69,354040,359790,"Social scientist write about the methods they use to collect and analyze social data, and "
Module_33_Report_Writing_70,359790,362480,about the results these methods yield. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_71,362480,365370,They rarely examine the process of writing itself. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_72,365370,373320,"A possible reason for this, as Bingham suggest is that, ‘writing has become viewed as a "
Module_33_Report_Writing_73,373320,380620,"process which is unproblematic and transparent’, and that this stems from the earlier emphasis "
Module_33_Report_Writing_74,380620,384110,placed on the realism in the social sciences. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_75,384110,390060,"In attempting to emulate the scientific community, the writing up of research was seen as an "
Module_33_Report_Writing_76,390060,397440,"objective process, whereby the researcher simply presented the result of an uncomplicated, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_77,397440,398490,straightforward fashion. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_78,398490,406500,"When we are feeling creative, our arguments and discussion might flow freely and this is "
Module_33_Report_Writing_79,406500,409890,when the writing process can be at most rewarding. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_80,409890,417620,"A word of caution, though, is getting carried away by these moments, we may forget to stop and reflect.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_81,417620,424220,"Similarly, in the moments when we face blocks in our writing, it is all too easy to get  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_82,424220,429090,frustrated because we just want the writing to keep moving. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_83,429090,433290,It is the time like when we need the discipline to say stop. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_84,433290,439460,It’s time to take a break and reflect on what we have done so far. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_85,439460,445550,"A strategy helps us to plan how to approach our writing, and work out how to deal with "
Module_33_Report_Writing_86,445550,447680,barriers when we inevitably face them. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_87,447680,454770,"Before we look at strategies for the actual process of writing, there are a few practical "
Module_33_Report_Writing_88,454770,459440,things that we can do in advance that will make the process easier. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_89,459440,467220,Cuba and Cocking suggest that appraising the environment in which we do a writing can be benificail.  
Module_33_Report_Writing_90,467220,473820,"They suggest that a number of questions relating to where, when, and how we write need to be "
Module_33_Report_Writing_91,473820,477460,addressed before we actually sit down to write. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_92,477460,479850,Some of these questions are outlined below. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_93,479850,484430,Is there a dedicated environment in which we can write? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_94,484430,490240,"If we are fortunate enough to have an office or study in which we can work, then this may "
Module_33_Report_Writing_95,490240,493120,prove to be the ideal environment. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_96,493120,498540,"If we are going to be using a shared environment, a shared office, university computer room, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_97,498540,507110,"a family room, the library, then we need to access at what time the space will be exclusively available to us.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_98,507110,513390,"Being interrupted during a particular productive writing session can be extremely frustrating,  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_99,513390,520460,so it is important to plan to write at times when interruptions are least likely. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_100,520460,525529,"The next question that comes to our mind is, when is the best time of day to write? "
Module_33_Report_Writing_101,525529,531230,"If we are fit fitting in writing around other commitments, then we shall have to try to "
Module_33_Report_Writing_102,531230,536330,"maximize our use of the time available, but if we know that we work better at certain "
Module_33_Report_Writing_103,536330,542740,"times of the day, and are able to, trying to plan to write at these times can help. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_104,542740,548050,"This may involve reorganizing other aspects of our lives, but it is it improves productivity, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_105,548050,550100,it will be worth it. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_106,550100,553960,How are we going to store our writings? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_107,553960,557890,Most formal writing nowadays is carried out on a word processor. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_108,557890,563450,This means thinking about electronic storage and peripherals such as printers. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_109,563450,569160,Saving work regularly is a habit most definitely worth getting into. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_110,569160,573150,Most word processing software packages have auto save features. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_111,573150,579870,By enabling these and making regular backup copies on other disk and storage devices we 
Module_33_Report_Writing_112,579870,586910,can avoid any any of the heart attack of losing a days’ worth of work. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_113,586910,593020,"Emailing files to oneself is also a good way of producing a backup copy, which is stored "
Module_33_Report_Writing_114,593020,599330,"on the server of our email client, which in turn will be regularly backed up. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_115,599330,602240,How familiar are we with the software? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_116,602240,606750,That's another question that we need to loo… s… look into. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_117,606750,612250,Word processing skills are common features of school curriculum and we often taught at 
Module_33_Report_Writing_118,612250,618430,"universities nowadays, but it is worth investigating the software we are using for additional features "
Module_33_Report_Writing_119,618430,621690,which may make the process of writing easier. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_120,621690,628840,Word processing packages come with the variety of automated features which make the organization 
Module_33_Report_Writing_121,628840,634600,and production of complex document a lot more manageable. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_122,634600,641140,Features such as word's auto-correct function enable abbreviations or shorthands to be used 
Module_33_Report_Writing_123,641140,644370,in place of words that are going to be used frequently. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_124,644370,651570,"The software is told which characters to replace with other words, so as the abbreviations "
Module_33_Report_Writing_125,651570,657170,"are entered, they are overwritten by the corresponding full length words or phrase. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_126,657170,664060,"It is worth becoming familiar with these features prior to starting our writing, and also investigating "
Module_33_Report_Writing_127,664060,668970,additional software that can be used to manage and organize references. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_128,668970,675900,"Such packages can be particularly helpful if we are producing a lengthy, heavy referenced text.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_129,675900,679230,The structure and  the style of research reports. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_130,679230,685680,Up till now we have tried to avoid being too perceptive when discussing the process of writing up.  
Module_33_Report_Writing_131,685680,691630,We have to recognize that different approaches to writing work better with some authors than 
Module_33_Report_Writing_132,691630,696860,"the others, and that our audience will partly dictate the way in which we write. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_133,696860,703220,"However, upon reading a variety of research reports, we may notice something encouraging "
Module_33_Report_Writing_134,703220,707160,about the way different authors organize their reports. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_135,707160,711339,This is one area where there does appear to be some consensus. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_136,711339,718980,"Whether a research is quantitative or qualitative in nature, the research reports need to consist "
Module_33_Report_Writing_137,718980,724420,"of a number of sections which deal with the different stages of, and rationale behind "
Module_33_Report_Writing_138,724420,725830,the research process. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_139,725830,732860,"The section we outline here are offered as a guide to structure, and should not be taken "
Module_33_Report_Writing_140,732860,735890,as the final word for the matter. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_141,735890,742740,Journal articles or these may have a predetermined list of headings which have to be adhered 
Module_33_Report_Writing_142,742740,748460,"to, but regardless of the precise wordings of the headings, the same elements will need "
Module_33_Report_Writing_143,748460,750650,to be included. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_144,750650,756339,What follows can be used as a checklist when writing up a research rou… projects. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_145,756339,764710,The very first thing the and the most important thing for a report writing is the title of the report. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_146,764710,766980,Sometimes the most obvious elements are overlooked. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_147,766980,774070,The title of the research should be made to be concise but also give a flavor of the purpose 
Module_33_Report_Writing_148,774070,775070,of the research. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_149,775070,780200,The title does not have to be the same as the research questions. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_150,780200,782980,This can be applied as a subtitle. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_151,782980,789740,"But sometimes when we have a whole series of research questions, even this may not be appropriate.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_152,789740,795851,To try to frame all of the objectives and research questions in the title would have 
Module_33_Report_Writing_153,795851,803779,"been futile, so instead the instead you choose the far shorter version that appears in print. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_154,803779,809810,"In addition to the title, the front page should contain the name of the author, date, name "
Module_33_Report_Writing_155,809810,812990,of any sponsor of the report. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_156,812990,817990,"After we have written the title, another thing which is very important and we should be keeping "
Module_33_Report_Writing_157,817990,820750,in mind is to write an abstract. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_158,820750,827210,"The abstract, while appearing at the front of the report, should be written last of all. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_159,827210,834310,In order to understand the purpose of an abstract it is useful to consider where we might come across them. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_160,834310,840410,"Earlier in the chapter, we mentioned using a database to aid with the literature searches. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_161,840410,845630,These often consist of a collection of abstracts which enable the researcher to decide upon 
Module_33_Report_Writing_162,845630,847959,the relevance of the sources. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_163,847959,852660,"With this in mind, consider what someone might be looking for in an abstract. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_164,852660,858740,"They would want to know the aim of the research, the methods employed, the outcomes of the "
Module_33_Report_Writing_165,858740,860910,"research, and any theoretical implications. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_166,860910,867470,"These, then, are the points which need to be covered in the abstract, but it must remain "
Module_33_Report_Writing_167,867470,872640,"brief, two hundred words is normally more than sufficient, and often abstract appear "
Module_33_Report_Writing_168,872640,875550,as single paragraphs. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_169,875550,880291,"Acknowledgement – There may be occasions where the success of a research product, project "
Module_33_Report_Writing_170,880291,887310,has been in part dependent on the services or guidance of certain individuals or organization. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_171,887310,893970,"In these instances, it is appropriate to acknowledge the ways in which your research has been helped. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_172,893970,899930,"It may be that, if we were carrying out a study which involved observing class activities "
Module_33_Report_Writing_173,899930,906660,"in school, we may wish to acknowledge the teachers who agree to let us sit in their class.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_174,906660,912350,"Acknowledgement should not be given at the expense of anonymity, it, if this has been "
Module_33_Report_Writing_175,912350,919390,"offered through, since in doing so, we would compromise ethical safeguards offered to participants. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_176,919390,926290,"Then, after acknowledgement, another important aspect is introduction of the report writing. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_177,926290,932350,The introduction and conclusion to any form of writing can be the most difficult elements 
Module_33_Report_Writing_178,932350,933790,to get right. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_179,933790,940070,The introduction serves a dual purpose of providing an idea as to the content of the 
Module_33_Report_Writing_180,940070,943250,report and convincing the reader that it is worth reading. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_181,943250,950959,"Gilbert says the introduction should, first, indicate the topic of the paper, demonstrate "
Module_33_Report_Writing_182,950959,956970,"why this topic is interesting and important, and show how the approach taken in the paper "
Module_33_Report_Writing_183,956970,960170,is an advance on previous work. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_184,960170,964660,"In brief, the purpose at the Introduction is to get the reader hooked. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_185,964660,971080,This means starting from the reader’s present knowledge and leading him or her on to seeing 
Module_33_Report_Writing_186,971080,977040,that the topic is worth spending some time investigating. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_187,977040,979690,The importance of captivating the readers cannot be overstated. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_188,979690,985470,It is min… misconception to assume that research will be read simply because it is 
Module_33_Report_Writing_189,985470,986920,inherent valuable. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_190,986920,993680,We must convince the reader that our addition to the body of knowledge is going to further 
Module_33_Report_Writing_191,993680,1000080,their understanding of the topic as well as providing an interesting read along the way. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_192,1000080,1003700,The next thi… next section is the literature review. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_193,1003700,1011110,"The introduction sets the scenes for the literature review, in that it states the objective and "
Module_33_Report_Writing_194,1011110,1013890,any hypotheses that are to be tested. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_195,1013890,1019680,"It also provides an overview of the theoretical framework and context, social, historical, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_196,1019680,1022160,"political, cultural, economic, geographical. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_197,1022160,1026280,The literature review then expands on this. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_198,1026280,1032510,It provides a justification for the research as well as a critical appraisal of the theoretical 
Module_33_Report_Writing_199,1032510,1037280,backdrop against which the data will be analyzed. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_200,1037280,1040670,The literature review helps to make sense of the research. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_201,1040670,1046740,"It should silence any doubt about why the research has been carried out, and it should "
Module_33_Report_Writing_202,1046740,1053190,demonstrate that we are conversant with the terminologies and theory which relate to the 
Module_33_Report_Writing_203,1053190,1057080,phenomenon under investigation. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_204,1057080,1062130,"Once we have done the literature review, we should focus on our research design and the "
Module_33_Report_Writing_205,1062130,1064430,methods that are used in it. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_206,1064430,1071130,"When describing our methods, it is necessary to provide sufficient detail so that the reader "
Module_33_Report_Writing_207,1071130,1075130,"could replicate our research design, if not our results. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_208,1075130,1078660,This enables the reader to affirm the reliability of the study. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_209,1078660,1084250,"In pursuing this aim, relevant elements from the following list should be included. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_210,1084250,1091920,"First, who is involved in the research- participants, organizations, and how these have been selected. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_211,1091920,1094679,"Second, how data have been collected. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_212,1094679,1097420,"Third, how data have been analyzed. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_213,1097420,1103549,"Fourth, any practical barriers which had to be overcome, such as access to sample or potential "
Module_33_Report_Writing_214,1103549,1104580,gap in the data. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_215,1104580,1106810,"Finally, ethical consideration arising from the research. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_216,1106810,1116010,One of the commitment we have as a researcher is to share not just what we have learnt from 
Module_33_Report_Writing_217,1116010,1122190,"what our results tell us, but our experiences of using our chosen methods. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_218,1122190,1127980,"In order for a reader to have confidence in our study and our interpretation of the data, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_219,1127980,1132980,he or she must be told about how the research progressed. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_220,1132980,1140000,"Once again, this requires reflection on the research process and demands that we question our methods. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_221,1140000,1147260,"No matter how carefully we design a research in advance, it is only upon completion, when "
Module_33_Report_Writing_222,1147260,1153230,"we look back over it, that we can truly scrutinize our methods. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_223,1153230,1159900,We need to ask whether the methods we applied were appropriate to our study. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_224,1159900,1167460,Key issues that have been addressed throughout this can be used to shape our methodological evaluation.  
Module_33_Report_Writing_225,1167460,1172240,"These include validity, reflexivity, objectivity, and ethics. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_226,1172240,1179960,These have already been dealt in detail while while explaining the qualitative research method module.  
Module_33_Report_Writing_227,1179960,1187070,In offering an evaluation it is important to admit to any subsequent shortcoming in the design.  
Module_33_Report_Writing_228,1187070,1193470,"If a research is being read in a critical manner by our readers, these will become evident "
Module_33_Report_Writing_229,1193470,1199460,and we shall be expected either to defend them or to accept them and take them into 
Module_33_Report_Writing_230,1199460,1202230,account with a discussion of data. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_231,1202230,1209600,The possible issues to be aware of are are limitations of the sample in terms of its 
Module_33_Report_Writing_232,1209600,1216200,"size, response rate and representativeness, for example, when reliance has been placed "
Module_33_Report_Writing_233,1216200,1223610,upon the succession of a snowballing approach to sampling which has resulted in fewer participants 
Module_33_Report_Writing_234,1223610,1230730,"being found than had been hoped, or low returns from a postal survey resulting in difficulties "
Module_33_Report_Writing_235,1230730,1234570,when analyzing small section of data. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_236,1234570,1241740,"Reliability of measurement, example, ambiguous questions in a survey or timing of events "
Module_33_Report_Writing_237,1241740,1245030,in an experiment by hand with a stopwatch. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_238,1245030,1250780,"Validity of indicators, for example where secondary data have been used and variables "
Module_33_Report_Writing_239,1250780,1258970,which relate to perceived level of crime have been analyzed as a representation of actual crime. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_240,1258970,1265480,"Ethical implications, for example, where data collected in an in-depth interview could potentially "
Module_33_Report_Writing_241,1265480,1272549,"reveal the identity of the interviewee, so very few co… quotes have been included in "
Module_33_Report_Writing_242,1272549,1275669,the analysis and discussion of the results. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_243,1275669,1280940,"Inappropriate analytical models, for example, where a causal relationship has been identified "
Module_33_Report_Writing_244,1280940,1287210,between two variables without using multivariate analysis to exclude the possible influence 
Module_33_Report_Writing_245,1287210,1289150,of third variable. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_246,1289150,1296330,"If textual data are quantified, this would also require justification, for these examples. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_247,1296330,1301910,Statement of results – When writing about our data we need to decide whether to present 
Module_33_Report_Writing_248,1301910,1308880,"the data first, and then discuss them in the in the ensuing section, or combine our discussion "
Module_33_Report_Writing_249,1308880,1311669,with the presentation of results. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_250,1311669,1318340,The formal former option has the advantage of allowing the readers to interpret the data 
Module_33_Report_Writing_251,1318340,1324470,by themselves and draw their ca… own conclusion about the implications of the results. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_252,1324470,1331600,"This can be favoured, as it enables us to defend a report against criticism of overly "
Module_33_Report_Writing_253,1331600,1333280,subjective interpretations. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_254,1333280,1342390,"If we assume this approach, data should be presented in such a way as to describe the results  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_255,1342390,1348940,"With quantitative data, this can be achieved with tebla... tables and graphs, and reference to figure.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_256,1348940,1355380,"Indeed, quantitative data lends themselves more readily to complete, summaries since "
Module_33_Report_Writing_257,1355380,1361220,large quantities of data can be summarized relatively easily in tables. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_258,1361220,1365840,"Qualitative data present a rather different challenge, though. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_259,1365840,1373309,Results can be described with reference to selected parts of the data which reflect a research question.  
Module_33_Report_Writing_260,1373309,1380330,"However, it is extremely unlikely, because of the expense of data that qualitative research "
Module_33_Report_Writing_261,1380330,1385679,"produces, that we will be able to offer a complete picture of it. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_262,1385679,1394700,"In deciding what to include and what not to, we must accept that we are introducing a degree of subjectivity.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_263,1394700,1401880,"There is no easy way around this, all we can do is try to ensure that a balanced picture "
Module_33_Report_Writing_264,1401880,1407750,"of the data is provided, by selecting data from different participants which provide "
Module_33_Report_Writing_265,1407750,1413330,an account of the completing perspective found in the data. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_266,1413330,1414940,Next step is the discussion. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_267,1414940,1422590,"Assuming that we have opted to provide a separate descriptive overview of the data, the discussion "
Module_33_Report_Writing_268,1422590,1428900,"provides an opportunity to reflect on the data, address a research question, and contextualize "
Module_33_Report_Writing_269,1428900,1433140,the findings within theory from the literature. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_270,1433140,1436120,This section should be the most enlightening. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_271,1436120,1441940,"In some respect, it is the reason for carrying out the research in the first place, since "
Module_33_Report_Writing_272,1441940,1448309,it is here where the way in which a research enhances knowledge comes to light. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_273,1448309,1454920,"The purpose of the, a research is addressed through our interpretation of data and how "
Module_33_Report_Writing_274,1454920,1460830,we see this fitting in what with what else is already known. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_275,1460830,1467360,The discussion relies heavily on the ability to link a research with the theory. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_276,1467360,1473530,"As discussed earlier in this chapter, we should make our position clear in relation to any "
Module_33_Report_Writing_277,1473530,1477400,debates or schools of thoughts in the field. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_278,1477400,1483020,"If we are using a particular model or philosophical perspective with which to interpret a data, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_279,1483020,1485820,this should be stated. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_280,1485820,1491740,"Finally, coming to the conclusion, writing conclusion in report writing. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_281,1491740,1498350,"Apart from the introduction, the conclusion is often the most difficult part of the report writing.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_282,1498350,1505021,"It is signi… it signifies the end of a lot of hard work, so we shall want to get it right. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_283,1505021,1512110,"It is also along the, along with the introduction and abstract, often the only part of the report "
Module_33_Report_Writing_284,1512110,1513570,that will get read. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_285,1513570,1519419,"The conclusion should draw the report to a close, by reiterating the main points, which "
Module_33_Report_Writing_286,1519419,1522580,might seek to address all the questions. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_287,1522580,1527950,"After conclusion, we would be giving references and bibliography. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_288,1527950,1534050,And in this throughout the write-up we will have made up reference to a number of sources. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_289,1534050,1536304,These all will need to be included in a list of references. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_290,1536304,1543650,"This is the minimum requirement, although there will be inevitable more sources that "
Module_33_Report_Writing_291,1543650,1549220,"you have used throughout the research process, but to which you have not cited a reference "
Module_33_Report_Writing_292,1549220,1551039,in the text. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_293,1551039,1556770,"These can still be included as a bibliography, as it provides the reader with a useful list "
Module_33_Report_Writing_294,1556770,1558830,of relevant material. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_295,1558830,1561270,What were the main findings of the research? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_296,1561270,1564840,How do these findings sit with the context of theory? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_297,1564840,1567260,What are the implications of the research? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_298,1567260,1571300,What lessons can be learned from the experience of carrying out the research? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_299,1571300,1574300,What can we learn from the way methods were employed? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_300,1574300,1577710,What areas are open for future research? 
Module_33_Report_Writing_301,1577710,1583640,"Appendices – It is the, it is easy to perceive appendices as a repos… repository for all "
Module_33_Report_Writing_302,1583640,1589090,the bits of a report that do not seem to fit else anywhere else. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_303,1589090,1593270,"However, appendices need to be carefully thought out and relevant. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_304,1593270,1599809,"Items such as copy of a questionnaire, interview schedule or observation plan are useful element "
Module_33_Report_Writing_305,1599809,1601280,of an appendix. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_306,1601280,1605809,"Statistical tables can be gathered together in an appendix, with only a selection relevant "
Module_33_Report_Writing_307,1605809,1609360,to the discussion dealt with the main body of the text. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_308,1609360,1615850,The important thing to remember is that appendices should be cross-referenced in the text. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_309,1615850,1621809,The reader should be made aware at what point during the report they need to turn to the 
Module_33_Report_Writing_310,1621809,1624570,appendix and make use of the information. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_311,1624570,1630580,"Without such clear signposting, the appendices will just take on the form of some additional "
Module_33_Report_Writing_312,1630580,1637230,information that has been included at the end to pad out the report. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_313,1637230,1642230,References and citation – We have placed a good deal of emphasis on the importance 
Module_33_Report_Writing_314,1642230,1648059,"of situating our research in the context of theory in the literature, in terms of both "
Module_33_Report_Writing_315,1648059,1649820,our topic and methods. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_316,1649820,1656159,"With this in mind, it is important to ss… understand how and when these references to "
Module_33_Report_Writing_317,1656159,1659520,others work should be included within our writing. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_318,1659520,1666169,"Moreover, it is important to have an idea of why they should be included, and we will "
Module_33_Report_Writing_319,1666169,1668570,turn our attention to this now. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_320,1668570,1674350,"When considering, why references are important, it is useful to consider who the practice "
Module_33_Report_Writing_321,1674350,1681190,"of citation affects and benefits, these are three interested parties with regard to referencing. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_322,1681190,1687559,"One, the reader-citing references directs the reader to the original source, therefore, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_323,1687559,1692490,enabling a more thorough understanding of our research and development of ideas. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_324,1692490,1698270,"Second, our writing may contain assumptions based on established theory. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_325,1698270,1704880,"It is not sufficient, however, merely to assume that the reader is familiar with with a particular "
Module_33_Report_Writing_326,1704880,1710240,theory and so it is necessary to provide readers with enough information to understand the 
Module_33_Report_Writing_327,1710240,1711240,topic. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_328,1711240,1717450,"Third, this can be done through the literature review, and by offering clues as to where "
Module_33_Report_Writing_329,1717450,1720192,they can pursue the topic in more depth throughout our references. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_330,1720192,1730170,"The cited authors we are showing our recognition of another individuals work, whether we are "
Module_33_Report_Writing_331,1730170,1731510,supporting it or criticizing it. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_332,1731510,1735090,This can enable constructive dialogue between writers. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_333,1735090,1740930,"In addition, sometimes an idea may have already been voiced so fluently that it would seem "
Module_33_Report_Writing_334,1740930,1744190,pointless to try to phrase it differently. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_335,1744190,1748980,"In these instances, it is useful to quote an author directly. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_336,1748980,1756000,"Ourselves not only does citing reference add credibility to our work, but it can also help "
Module_33_Report_Writing_337,1756000,1762420,to avoid legal complications brought about by wrongfully passing of another's work as our own.  
Module_33_Report_Writing_338,1762420,1767480,"Finally, the polishing up and finishing off in report writing.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_339,1767480,1775570,"Having planned, organized, structured, drafted, referred and rewritten our research, we are now "
Module_33_Report_Writing_340,1775570,1779049,finally nearing the end of the writing-up process. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_341,1779049,1785580,By this stage in our writing we should have something that could almost be called a finished product.  
Module_33_Report_Writing_342,1785580,1789980,The structure and content will have been established through redrafting. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_343,1789980,1795919,"So at this point we can turn our attention to the finer points, such as presentation, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_344,1795919,1800400,"formatting, and small refinements in our use of language. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_345,1800400,1805179,"Once we have checked all the points that we discussed in our report writing, with the "
Module_33_Report_Writing_346,1805179,1809280,"our, our report is in the final stage. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_347,1809280,1818539,"So, this is how we can write a report and finally give our results in a systematic manner. S…  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_348,1818539,1822700,"To conclude, the writing-up process should be an enjoyable one since it enables us to "
Module_33_Report_Writing_349,1822700,1827990,bring together all the other stages of the research process into an end product. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_350,1827990,1835809,"It should not be seen as an easy process, though it requires planning, motivation, organization and reflection.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_351,1835809,1843230,"It handled poorly, if it handled poorly, it can prove to be the undoing of a lot of hard work.  "
Module_33_Report_Writing_352,1843230,1848890,The writing up process needs to be treated with respect to view writing as unproblematic 
Module_33_Report_Writing_353,1848890,1855370,"and transparent, as merely a simple way of reporting our research is a terrible mistake. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_354,1855370,1860450,It is necessary to remember the objectives of writing up research that we have discussed 
Module_33_Report_Writing_355,1860450,1866100,"and these are to address our research questions, to discuss our findings, to conceptualize "
Module_33_Report_Writing_356,1866100,1872620,"our research within a broad theoretical framework, and to reflect on the research process, to "
Module_33_Report_Writing_357,1872620,1876059,"share our experiences, and to contribute to methodological debates. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_358,1876059,1883630,"Finally, we have seen the importance of some of the convention of academic writing, references, "
Module_33_Report_Writing_359,1883630,1886450,"presentation, structure and format. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_360,1886450,1891910,Writing up research is a different process from the that involved in other forms of writing. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_361,1891910,1898150,"We must recognize this, and not assume that because we have spent our whole life writing "
Module_33_Report_Writing_362,1898150,1902919,in other forms that writing up research will come easily to us. 
Module_33_Report_Writing_363,1902919,1909539,"As with many skills, the key to successful and enjoyable writing is the practice. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_364,1909539,1914200,"Thus, I hope the this will help you in writing your report successfully. "
Module_33_Report_Writing_365,1914200,1920260,Any queries that you have on this you can always revert back to me or you can write to me.  
Module_33_Report_Writing_366,1920260,1924190,Hope you you are able to write up your data in a very beautiful and nice manner.

Module_5_Research_problem_10,85350,90190,All research problems are driven by social problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_11,90190,97280,"Problem solving aptitude is a natural quality given by nature to all for their survival, "
Module_5_Research_problem_12,97280,107250,"but human being is the only creature blessed with the thinking process, with vision, imagination, "
Module_5_Research_problem_13,107250,109750,creativity and innovation.

Module_5_Research_problem_15,116990,118970,to his wish. 
Module_5_Research_problem_16,118970,125140,If man feels anything problematic only then he thinks to change. 
Module_5_Research_problem_17,125140,133700,Various research methods are used to resolve any problematic stage. 
Module_5_Research_problem_18,133700,141209,Selection of research pro… methodology depends on nature of research problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_19,141209,145690,Selection of research problem is the first step in every research. 
Module_5_Research_problem_20,145690,155340,No research can undergo by the researcher unless he first formulate the research problem 
Module_5_Research_problem_21,155340,159739,properly and scientifically. 
Module_5_Research_problem_22,159739,167959,Concept of problem is basically a psychological aspect which can be caused by either physical 
Module_5_Research_problem_23,167959,170519,or mental facts. 
Module_5_Research_problem_24,170519,179380,Research can be performed only after psychological involvement of researcher with the problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_25,179380,190959,"Studying any research is not independent subject and cannot be studied, ignoring the personality "
Module_5_Research_problem_26,190959,195409,traits and skills of the researcher. 
Module_5_Research_problem_27,195409,202920,That means for the formulation of research problem involvement of researcher plays a 
Module_5_Research_problem_28,202920,206659,very important part. 
Module_5_Research_problem_29,206659,214379,Research can be performed only after realization and sensitization of researchers towards the 
Module_5_Research_problem_30,214379,226810,real research problem and thereafter only he can formulate any real practical problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_31,226810,233560,Characteristics of research problem – There are some general assumptions as to any problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_32,233560,239939,"First, no problem comes from vacuum. "
Module_5_Research_problem_33,239939,242359,And every problem has their solution. 
Module_5_Research_problem_34,242359,253269,"First postulates shows that every problem what you realize has its certain components, "
Module_5_Research_problem_35,253269,262450,"its history, origin and other variables involved in composing such problem. "
Module_5_Research_problem_36,262450,271190,"Problem does not come from vacuum like, immediately it it exits or disappear. "
Module_5_Research_problem_37,271190,277440,"Whatever you feel problematic, it has some evidences wi.. which have to be collected "
Module_5_Research_problem_38,277440,280710,by keen investigation. 
Module_5_Research_problem_39,280710,284630,Every problem has their solution. 
Module_5_Research_problem_40,284630,290950,Whatever phenomena or situation you perceive as problematic. 
Module_5_Research_problem_41,290950,294940,I assure you that every problem has the solution. 
Module_5_Research_problem_42,294940,304030,This is your quality how to find out the solution. 
Module_5_Research_problem_43,304030,311600,"In ordinary sense we can say that dissatisfaction is the first point, which originates any problem. "
Module_5_Research_problem_44,311600,323220,The term problem may be explained as dissatisfaction of any person as to any subject of his life. 
Module_5_Research_problem_45,323220,329030,"Every problem arises from dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction is a mental element and it "
Module_5_Research_problem_46,329030,336690,"is always related to present fact, even if a man is worry about his future, the subject "
Module_5_Research_problem_47,336690,348350,"matter of his anxiety may be past, of present or of future, but the state of anxiety is present. "
Module_5_Research_problem_48,348350,358660,"For any research, the researcher should have that state of mind present that the research "
Module_5_Research_problem_49,358660,362880,problem exists somewhere in his life. 
Module_5_Research_problem_50,362880,374430,"If he seriously considers all the variables facts, phenomena about such problem he can "
Module_5_Research_problem_51,374430,381530,further proceed to formulate research problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_52,381530,392630,"If a man perceive anything, phenomena dissatisfied to his person, in that case immediately he "
Module_5_Research_problem_53,392630,398340,try to convert his state of dissatisfaction to satisfaction. 
Module_5_Research_problem_54,398340,404221,"If man knows how be satisfied immediately he can act towards the satisfaction, but if "
Module_5_Research_problem_55,404221,409000,he does not possess any experience or knowledge with such problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_56,409000,411660,How to solve that problem? 
Module_5_Research_problem_57,411660,419020,In that case he has to undergo with research process. 
Module_5_Research_problem_58,419020,426640,Before selecting any research problem certain points should be clearly analyzed and dis… 
Module_5_Research_problem_59,426640,427640,determined by the researcher. 
Module_5_Research_problem_60,427640,432990,First that the problem should not be fictitious. 
Module_5_Research_problem_61,432990,445710,"No problem, which is fictitious only not exist anywhere in this world cannot be the good "
Module_5_Research_problem_62,445710,454920,"subject for research, because the use of sources, time and money will be wastage, will be of "
Module_5_Research_problem_63,454920,459560,no utility for the society. 
Module_5_Research_problem_64,459560,467460,"Second, any problem, any phenomena which is selected for research that problematic situation, "
Module_5_Research_problem_65,467460,471910,phenomena or the factor should be of permanent nature. 
Module_5_Research_problem_66,471910,478580,"Studying on any factor which cause you dissatisfaction temporally for the short while, which is not "
Module_5_Research_problem_67,478580,486670,repeated again and there is no scope of its repetition in your future. In that case studying 
Module_5_Research_problem_68,486670,493670,on such problem is useless. 
Module_5_Research_problem_69,493670,498080,Any problem selected for research should be of high significance value. 
Module_5_Research_problem_70,498080,506740,Here the ss… significance value means the pro… nature of problem should be of common 
Module_5_Research_problem_71,506740,515529,for all; whatever the suggestion and the solution will come that may be utilized and should 
Module_5_Research_problem_72,515529,518910,be benefited to the high number of beneficiary. 
Module_5_Research_problem_73,518910,531300,"If the size of beneficiary group is higher that means its significance value is higher  76 00:08:51,300 -->  00:09:02,500 and if its size of beneficiaries are lesser its significance val… value is also re… lesser. "
Module_5_Research_problem_74,542500,547020,There are certain common steps of formulation of research problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_75,547020,553070,First any problematic phenomena realized by the researcher itself is not sufficient to 
Module_5_Research_problem_76,553070,555900,be selected immediately for research problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_77,555900,562820,There are certain scientific steps which have to be strictly followed for the formulation 
Module_5_Research_problem_78,562820,571611,"of research problem; first realization of problem, then identification of problem, analysis "
Module_5_Research_problem_79,571611,575580,of problem and last is the statement of problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_80,575580,583480,The problem is finally formulated with the is… its statement of problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_81,583480,594180, Realization of problem – researcher should realize or sensitize with the existence of problem.  
Module_5_Research_problem_82,594180,599500,Any problem assigned for research which has not been realized by the researcher as to 
Module_5_Research_problem_83,599500,603580,its nature existence and its evil effects. 
Module_5_Research_problem_84,603580,611390,"Though the researcher can undergo with the research but he cannot check its effects, "
Module_5_Research_problem_85,611390,619050,he because he cannot realize its effects suggested by him. 
Module_5_Research_problem_86,619050,629570,"In all other terms, it, it is said that the victim can be good researcher for any research, "
Module_5_Research_problem_87,629570,636480,"the person who is s… really suffered with any problem, who is victim of problem, he "
Module_5_Research_problem_88,636480,638080,can be the good researcher. 
Module_5_Research_problem_89,638080,648770,"It does not mean any person, whoever whether it is victim, stakeholder or other who understand "
Module_5_Research_problem_90,648770,652960,"the pain or difficulties of life, caused by such problem may undergo research. "
Module_5_Research_problem_91,652960,664050,The poor scholar who is in one geographical area can also research on these social problem 
Module_5_Research_problem_92,664050,666960,of another geographical area like terrorism. 
Module_5_Research_problem_93,666960,679750,Terrorism is a problem in certain disturbed areas of a country but any person who realize

Module_5_Research_problem_104,741470,748040,"Positive sign denotes the satisfaction, negative sign denotes its dissatisfaction of mind. "
Module_5_Research_problem_105,748040,755610,"In turn, dissatisfaction proceeds for alteration, amendment, improvement and replacement, such "
Module_5_Research_problem_106,755610,762130,"realization of a stimulus, the researcher to feel about their negative attributes or "
Module_5_Research_problem_107,762130,766500,something lacking. 
Module_5_Research_problem_108,766500,774820,"After realization or sensitization of problem, second step to be performed by the researcher "
Module_5_Research_problem_109,774820,778250,that is the identification of problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_110,778250,781630,The researcher must identify the problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_111,781630,795170,Whatever he realize he should get it be tested that whether what he feel problematic exist or not.  
Module_5_Research_problem_112,795170,808000,After sometime any problem which is realized by the researcher 
Module_5_Research_problem_113,808000,818120,and if he go to corroborates such problem he comes to know that his realization of problem 
Module_5_Research_problem_114,818120,824250,"was not correct, that was sometime misconception or misunderstanding of phenomena or it may "
Module_5_Research_problem_115,824250,827600,be illusion or delusion. 
Module_5_Research_problem_116,827600,839671,"Understanding any fact involved is the identification process, for the identification of such research "
Module_5_Research_problem_117,839671,847290,problem facts involved in the research problem he must go with the corroboration of opinion. 
Module_5_Research_problem_118,847290,854330,Whatever opinion he form as to the existence or nature of problem he must get it be corroborated 
Module_5_Research_problem_119,854330,856000,by some other persons. 
Module_5_Research_problem_120,856000,863770,"Researcher should discuss his observation regarding problem with stakeholders, experts "
Module_5_Research_problem_121,863770,870279,and to invite their opinion on such problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_122,870279,876560,At the same time researcher can go through with the available literature to get acquainted 
Module_5_Research_problem_123,876560,881390,himself with the selected problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_124,881390,889940,Study of literature for the corroboration of own opinion as to any research problem 
Module_5_Research_problem_125,889940,892890,is the review of literature. 
Module_5_Research_problem_126,892890,896680,Review of literature is basically a step of corroboration of opinion. 
Module_5_Research_problem_127,896680,905730,It is mandatory and formal step followed in every research process. 
Module_5_Research_problem_128,905730,912190,"Researcher has to consult as possible as with the, with all lit… relevant literature containing "
Module_5_Research_problem_129,912190,917160,information regarding subject matter of research. 
Module_5_Research_problem_130,917160,926040,"He may review literature of two types, first the conceptual literature, literature concerning "
Module_5_Research_problem_131,926040,931600,the concepts and theories relating to the matter in hand. 
Module_5_Research_problem_132,931600,939730,"Second, the empirical literature consist consisting of all such studies made earlier, which are "
Module_5_Research_problem_133,939730,943180,similar to the proposal. 
Module_5_Research_problem_134,943180,949660,"After analyzing such facts, information, and principles, he can sharpen his vision towards "
Module_5_Research_problem_135,949660,957530,"the problem, so that his perception towards the problem would be more accurate. "
Module_5_Research_problem_136,957530,964320,"After identification of problem, the third step that is the analysis of problem, under "
Module_5_Research_problem_137,964320,975021,"this step researcher has to analyze all such facts which constitute the problem, nature "
Module_5_Research_problem_138,975021,978140,of problem and their effects. 
Module_5_Research_problem_139,978140,985440,"There can be a detailed description of the circumstances under which it occurs nature, "
Module_5_Research_problem_140,985440,992280,"symptom, progressions and frequency, et cetera and the analysis become necessary. "
Module_5_Research_problem_141,992280,999269,"This will help to understand the context, nature and effect of such problem. "
Module_5_Research_problem_142,999269,1008190,Steps of analysis of problem - Analysis of problem contain three major steps as description 
Module_5_Research_problem_143,1008190,1015110,"of problem, understanding of problem, and explanation thereof. "
Module_5_Research_problem_144,1015110,1022860,"In analysis process researcher has to analyse the problem on following aspects, whether "
Module_5_Research_problem_145,1022860,1027779,problem is of temporaly temporary nature or permanent nature. 
Module_5_Research_problem_146,1027779,1032630,"What are the constituents of problem, determination of relevant variables? "
Module_5_Research_problem_147,1032630,1036230,What factors are responsible for causing such problem? 
Module_5_Research_problem_148,1036230,1046400,Whether such factors responsible for causing problem are of internal nature or external one? 
Module_5_Research_problem_149,1046400,1057650,Nature of problem as to its temporary temporal nature or permanent nature must be verified 
Module_5_Research_problem_150,1057650,1061790,by the researcher before selection of research problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_151,1061790,1069420,Many times in our life we come across to su… some circumstances and situation which are 
Module_5_Research_problem_152,1069420,1076690,dissatisfactory for us and after passing them we neither go to look into or to investigate 
Module_5_Research_problem_153,1076690,1083679,"such problem, nor interested to research because we are well assured that such happening was "
Module_5_Research_problem_154,1083679,1092350,"by chance or incidental only, which would not occur again in our life or losses caused "
Module_5_Research_problem_155,1092350,1096270,by such incidents are not very high. 
Module_5_Research_problem_156,1096270,1100470,Such problems are of temporal nature. 
Module_5_Research_problem_157,1100470,1108270,"Any problem, which is of temporal nature does not affect our life very seriously and not "
Module_5_Research_problem_158,1108270,1112290,exist persistently in our life. 
Module_5_Research_problem_159,1112290,1120590,Such problems are not researchable since the researcher knows that the results may be beneficial 
Module_5_Research_problem_160,1120590,1128940,"only for his personal knowledge, but such knowledge has no further utility, unless there "
Module_5_Research_problem_161,1128940,1133500,is any possibility of their repetition in our life further. 
Module_5_Research_problem_162,1133500,1140470,While selecting any researcher problem researcher must see that problem should not be of temporary 
Module_5_Research_problem_163,1140470,1149530,"nature, it should be of permanent nature which requires human interception. "
Module_5_Research_problem_164,1149530,1157350,Constituents of problem - Determination of constituents of problem is the part of analytic process.  
Module_5_Research_problem_165,1157350,1159710,No problem come from vacuum. 
Module_5_Research_problem_166,1159710,1169429,This postulate gives the direction that any problem in hand must be studied in such a 
Module_5_Research_problem_167,1169429,1176580,"way so that we can ascertain its consequent factors, variables and other facts involved "
Module_5_Research_problem_168,1176580,1183510,"in the process, which makes that phenomena problematic. "
Module_5_Research_problem_169,1183510,1189270,Researcher has to search and analyse all those facts which are the part of any problematic 
Module_5_Research_problem_170,1189270,1191970,"incidence, phenomenon or transaction. "
Module_5_Research_problem_171,1191970,1198590,This process is called crystallization of problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_172,1198590,1206670,Crystallization of problem is a process commonly used at the stage of this analysis of research problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_173,1206670,1214560,"Especially in diagnostic research, crysta… crystallization process is very important. "
Module_5_Research_problem_174,1214560,1219950,Sometimes the causes of problem are directly highlighted through analysis at the early 
Module_5_Research_problem_175,1219950,1222480,stage of research. 
Module_5_Research_problem_176,1222480,1229000,Another philosophy behind crystallization of constituent is to direct the approach which 
Module_5_Research_problem_177,1229000,1241270,suggests that the fact constituting the phenomena must be keenly observed. 
Module_5_Research_problem_178,1241270,1249220,After keen analysis of the facts and factors involved in any problem the person can be 
Module_5_Research_problem_179,1249220,1258080,assured that in what direction with what facts he has to study for solution. 
Module_5_Research_problem_180,1258080,1263100,Crystallization also shows the nature and relationship of variables which is necessary 
Module_5_Research_problem_181,1263100,1267770,to be determined in every research. 
Module_5_Research_problem_182,1267770,1274549,Determination of variables - After crystallization of problem researcher has to determine the 
Module_5_Research_problem_183,1274549,1283620,"relevant variables or relevant facts among all constituent, constituting variables or facts. "
Module_5_Research_problem_184,1283620,1292760,He has to analyze that what facts among other facts are somewhere concerned for their problem 
Module_5_Research_problem_185,1292760,1297290,or may be responsible for their problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_186,1297290,1304049,And he has to filter those facts and to focus his studies further only on those variables 
Module_5_Research_problem_187,1304049,1308200,which he has selected for the investigation. 
Module_5_Research_problem_188,1308200,1314260,"To ascertain that what may be the important facts responsible for occurrence of any problem, "
Module_5_Research_problem_189,1314260,1323220,among oth… all other variables selected filter for the study he has to focus on some 
Module_5_Research_problem_190,1323220,1335360,"major facts which are can be held responsible with their major contribution for occurrence, "
Module_5_Research_problem_191,1335360,1337710,subsistence and continuance of such problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_192,1337710,1343840,"There is a principle that any problematic phenomenon, transaction or incidence perceived "
Module_5_Research_problem_193,1343840,1351780,"problematic may occur due to the composition of facts in a certain manner, but such problem "
Module_5_Research_problem_194,1351780,1356440,cannot subsist long unless nurtured by other factors. 
Module_5_Research_problem_195,1356440,1365760,Any such problem which exist in your life is no doubt the composition of facts which 
Module_5_Research_problem_196,1365760,1374549,"co… causes any incidence for phenomena problematic, but it cannot maintain further unless it has "
Module_5_Research_problem_197,1374549,1381280,any other supporting factors to maintain its existence. 
Module_5_Research_problem_198,1381280,1388220,Such supporting factors are those factors which can be held responsible for the nurturing 
Module_5_Research_problem_199,1388220,1390220,of problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_200,1390220,1394430,These factors may be the internal or external. 
Module_5_Research_problem_201,1394430,1400250,"Internal factors are those factors which are hidden in problem itself, and they can be "
Module_5_Research_problem_202,1400250,1403990,searched by the crystallization of problematic phenomena. 
Module_5_Research_problem_203,1403990,1414650,Whereas external factors are those factors which do not constitute the part of constituents 
Module_5_Research_problem_204,1414650,1419640,of research problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_205,1419640,1427820,Problem depending on other factors which are not the part of constituents of the problem 
Module_5_Research_problem_206,1427820,1440429,"which is the external member and form outside, it manipulates the facts which results in problem. "
Module_5_Research_problem_207,1440429,1448190,These factors are called independent variables and problem is called de… dependent variables. 
Module_5_Research_problem_208,1448190,1454370,Independent variables means those variables which though responsible for occurrence of 
Module_5_Research_problem_209,1454370,1462470,"problem and their manipulation affect the problem, but here effect in any problem shall "
Module_5_Research_problem_210,1462470,1465500,not affect those variables in turn. 
Module_5_Research_problem_211,1465500,1474570,That is why these variables are called independent and our problem depends on the existence and 
Module_5_Research_problem_212,1474570,1476950,varia… variations of such facts. 
Module_5_Research_problem_213,1476950,1480640,That is why this problem is called dependent variable. 
Module_5_Research_problem_214,1480640,1486100,"After the analysis of problem, the final stage of formulation of problem that is the statement "
Module_5_Research_problem_215,1486100,1488000,of problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_216,1488000,1496360,When the problem actually comes into shape of statement whatever be the understanding 
Module_5_Research_problem_217,1496360,1502750,and perception made by the researcher after crystallization and keen analysis of problem 
Module_5_Research_problem_218,1502750,1509250,thereafter he makes the statement regarding existence of problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_219,1509250,1516390,This statement may be in verbal form or in written form. 
Module_5_Research_problem_220,1516390,1523520,Statement must convey the real nature of problem as it is as realized and felt by the researcher. 
Module_5_Research_problem_221,1523520,1530260,While formulating research problem researcher has to be very careful as to the use of language 
Module_5_Research_problem_222,1530260,1532060,and grammar. 
Module_5_Research_problem_223,1532060,1535260,"Language should be clear, easy, and unambiguous. "
Module_5_Research_problem_224,1535260,1546120,This is that stage when the problem is conveyed by the researcher and submitted for the further 
Module_5_Research_problem_225,1546120,1548630,research process. 
Module_5_Research_problem_226,1548630,1558450,"If the researcher is weak in understanding, language, grammar and communicating the problem, "
Module_5_Research_problem_227,1558450,1566690,"in that case, it may be the negativity on the part of researcher. "
Module_5_Research_problem_228,1566690,1574250,After making the statement as to the existence of any research and analyzing the variables 
Module_5_Research_problem_229,1574250,1582970,"responsible for the problem, the problem can be classified on the basis of its variables, "
Module_5_Research_problem_230,1582970,1592179,independent and dependent variables; such relation is studied by the research designing 
Module_5_Research_problem_231,1592179,1598150,according to the nature of research formulated by researcher. 
Module_5_Research_problem_232,1598150,1606050,"Kind of research problem can be classified as uni-variable problem, bi-variable problem, "
Module_5_Research_problem_233,1606050,1612890,multi-variables problem or opponent variables problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_234,1612890,1618230,Uni-variable problem is the problem where pro… formulated after following certain 
Module_5_Research_problem_235,1618230,1625830,hypothesis and hypothesis denoting that any single independent variable is responsible 
Module_5_Research_problem_236,1625830,1628480,for the problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_237,1628480,1638650,And whole study is focused to study about the that individual factor stated in the hypothesis 
Module_5_Research_problem_238,1638650,1643220,as single variable or uni-variable. 
Module_5_Research_problem_239,1643220,1650070,After completion of research the hypothesis is tested if that variable is really responsible 
Module_5_Research_problem_240,1650070,1659880,for the problem means your hypothesis has been proved and if the variable is stated 
Module_5_Research_problem_241,1659880,1667380,held responsible for the problem is not found true means hypothesis is disproved and researcher 
Module_5_Research_problem_242,1667380,1670760,should move for further investigation. 
Module_5_Research_problem_243,1670760,1679309,"Second, bi-variable problem where hypothesis suggests inferences on two different independent "
Module_5_Research_problem_244,1679309,1685280,variables responsible for occurrence of the problem is called bi-variable problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_245,1685280,1691790,Researcher has to focus attention at the same time on two independent variables. 
Module_5_Research_problem_246,1691790,1700440,He has to investigate and thereafter he has to determine this thing whether both the variables 
Module_5_Research_problem_247,1700440,1705130,are responsible for the problem or any one of them. 
Module_5_Research_problem_248,1705130,1711760,"If both the variables are found responsible, then he has to look the major contribution "
Module_5_Research_problem_249,1711760,1714690,of any variable. 
Module_5_Research_problem_250,1714690,1723059,"The variable who is found, who has contributed as major variable who is found as major variable "
Module_5_Research_problem_251,1723059,1729429,for the problem is called the major variable and other variable who studied together with 
Module_5_Research_problem_252,1729429,1740010,"the major variable is called the minor variable and if after investigation, it is decided "
Module_5_Research_problem_253,1740010,1744669,that one of the variable is responsible and other is not. 
Module_5_Research_problem_254,1744669,1749190,"In that case, one hypothesis is disproved and other is proved. "
Module_5_Research_problem_255,1749190,1759680,"After this bi-variable problem, another nature or problem is multi-variable problem, where "
Module_5_Research_problem_256,1759680,1770549,number of variables are held responsible for existence of any problem in the hypothesis. 
Module_5_Research_problem_257,1770549,1777799,Hypothesis suggesting that number of variables more than two variables are responsible for 
Module_5_Research_problem_258,1777799,1781200,existence of problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_259,1781200,1789340,This research process is very difficult because at the same time researcher has to focus on 
Module_5_Research_problem_260,1789340,1802150,"all suspected variables and he has to be independent, unbiased and objectives towards scheme investigation "
Module_5_Research_problem_261,1802150,1806440,in the light of relation of problem with the variables. 
Module_5_Research_problem_262,1806440,1814030,Gradually with the study he moved from multi-variables to individual variables and come to conclusion 
Module_5_Research_problem_263,1814030,1821390,"whether all variables stated in hypothesis are causing problem or some of them, or none "
Module_5_Research_problem_264,1821390,1823170,of them. 
Module_5_Research_problem_265,1823170,1834490,"On the basis of classification of variables, the last classification is opponent variable "
Module_5_Research_problem_266,1834490,1840150,problem where there is a question between two or more inconsistent variables. 
Module_5_Research_problem_267,1840150,1845970,"Whether A is the cause of problem or B is the cause of problem, where A and B cannot "
Module_5_Research_problem_268,1845970,1850720,"stand together in such cases, two hypothesis are formulated. "
Module_5_Research_problem_269,1850720,1861740,"First alleges the role of A variable and second on B. On proving one hypothesis other is rejected, "
Module_5_Research_problem_270,1861740,1870650,living example of this opponent variable problem is the determination of paternity where two 
Module_5_Research_problem_271,1870650,1881140,or more persons are suspected for ascertaining the paternity of any child. 
Module_5_Research_problem_272,1881140,1894720,Natural signs provide that all the suspects cannot to be held responsible under the for 
Module_5_Research_problem_273,1894720,1896840,this nature of problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_274,1896840,1906559,"In that case, only those variables which are suspected or studied under this process and "
Module_5_Research_problem_275,1906559,1914470,thereafter the researcher comes with the final conclusion as to the role of any one of the

Module_5_Research_problem_277,1921830,1931960,"After analyzing as to the nature of research problem, formulation of research problem or  289 00:32:11,960 -->  00:32:22,679 other important aspects relating to realization of problem, formulation of problem and classification of problem. "
Module_5_Research_problem_278,1942679,1951330,"Here on final conclusion, it can be summarize as, the formulation of research problem is "
Module_5_Research_problem_279,1951330,1957950,as mental and psychological process which can be completed with the proper involvement

Module_5_Research_problem_281,1960650,1966940,"First is the realization, after realization of the problem researcher come with the identification "
Module_5_Research_problem_282,1966940,1973750,of problem; for the identification he has to verify the facts with the corroborative 
Module_5_Research_problem_283,1973750,1981120,"opinion of other persons, review of literature all existing literature as maximum as possible "
Module_5_Research_problem_284,1981120,1986659,should be researched properly for determination of research problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_285,1986659,1992780,And review of literature is further beneficial to the researcher for his further studying

Module_5_Research_problem_287,1997550,2005890,"Statement of problem that is final shape of research problem, should be properly, systematically, "
Module_5_Research_problem_288,2005890,2011789,grammatically correct and the statement or problem should convey the same feeling and 
Module_5_Research_problem_289,2011789,2018850,experience as researcher conceives in this mind as to the nature and existence of problem. 
Module_5_Research_problem_290,2018850,2021529,Thank you. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_0,49,1049,Hello everyone. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_1,1049,6470,Welcome back to a new module of Research Methodology that is Quantitative Research. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_2,6470,11390,"As of now we have done various modules on Research Methodology, but whenever we talk "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_3,11390,17539,"about research, this is one thing that comes to our mind is quantitative research and qualitative research. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_4,17539,22759,"Today, I, Doctor Ritu Sharma would be dealing with this quantitative research module with "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_5,22759,24619,you under the MOOCs program. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_6,24619,30650,"So, while dealing with the quantitative module, we will be discussing an overview of the characteristics "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_7,30650,31810,of quantitative research. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_8,31810,36460,We’ll be investigating the difference stages of the research processes in experimental 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_9,36460,37760,and sample survey methods. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_10,37760,44829,Then we will examine the process for drawing on accurate and representative sample at the population. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_11,44829,49640,"Then we’ll provide an appraisal of the different questions type, measures and indicators which "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_12,49640,51320,are used in designing the questionnaire. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_13,51320,56379,"Finally, we’ll highlight the main issues confronting social researchers when using "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_14,56379,60809,"quantitative approach and methods in the research product, projects. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_15,60809,66880,The term quantitative method refers in large part of the adoption of the natural sciences 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_16,66880,69470,experiment as the model for scientific research. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_17,69470,74500,Its key feature being quantitative measurement of the phenomenon studied and systematically 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_18,74500,79440,control of the theoretical variables influi… influencing those phenomena. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_19,79440,85590,"Thus, the logic of such reaso… research is to first collect data using standardized "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_20,85590,88640,approaches on a range of variables. S… 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_21,88640,94341,"Second, search for patterns of causal relationship between these variables and third, test given "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_22,94341,98220,theory by confirming or denying the precise hypothesis. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_23,98220,103660,The method employed in this type of quantitative social research are most typically the sample 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_24,103660,106140,survey and the experimental method. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_25,106140,110280,A method that is particularly popular in social sciences research. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_26,110280,115110,The sample survey is the most commonly used technique for gathering information whether 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_27,115110,116880,by quantitative or qualitative. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_28,116880,123140,Surveys are based on using statistical sampling method by taking a representative sample from 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_29,123140,129000,a given population and applying a standard research instrument in the form of a structured 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_30,129000,134740,questionnaire surveys enable descriptive and explanatory generalization to be made about 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_31,134740,137310,the population in question. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_32,137310,141080,Quantitative approach differ from qualitative approach in a number of ways.  
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_33,141080,146780,"And, ee… most importantly there is a relatively high degree of pre-conceptualization associated "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_34,146780,148960,with quantitative-based research. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_35,148960,154069,"Adapting the theory then research approach, researcher working within this tradition will "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_36,154069,159830,have certain a priori assumption about exactly what research questions to address and how 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_37,159830,162260,these should be formulated. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_38,162260,166150,How the study should be designed including which research tools to use? 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_39,166150,171970,How data collec… is collected and how it is organized and the intended methods of analysis.

Module_18_Quantitative_Research_41,175990,181270,This approach contrast saa… sharply with qualitative approach which as we have seen 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_42,181270,188580,"are typically involved in exploratory research, in which the objective is to open up a research question. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_43,188580,194310,"Here, the research strategy is guided by the reality of conducting a research project. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_44,194310,200069,Decisions about how a qualitative-based research study is to progress often takes place during 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_45,200069,204510,"the course of the research itself, rather than before it has begun. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_46,204510,209740,"In this module, we’ll try to understand use of both experiment and sample surveys, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_47,209740,215890,"some of their advantage and disadvantage, the issues that arise by their use. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_48,215890,220800,"Design issues and techniques in experiments and sample survey will be reviewed, like types "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_49,220800,224630,"of method used, different sampling strategies and so on. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_50,224630,230240,Together with an overview of the debate concerning the legitimacy of these quantitative method 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_51,230240,232430,within the social sciences. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_52,232430,237340,Experimental research – Experiments are most commonly used in psychological research 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_53,237340,243420,"and in the broad field of business studies, particularly in organizational research. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_54,243420,250200,Experimental research is based on researcher manipulating certain controlled conditions 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_55,250200,254709,in order to identify the relationship between particular variables that it is hoped will 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_56,254709,257629,explain cause-and-effect relationship. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_57,257629,263919,In seeking to measure the impact that one factor has on another by controlling all the 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_58,263919,270499,"other factor that might have an effect, experimental research build on the principle of a positivist "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_59,270499,275490,approach to science more than any other research techniques. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_60,275490,279509,Experiments can be carried out in either a laboratory or a field setting. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_61,279509,284900,"Laboratory experimentation is most closely regulated method of experiment, involving "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_62,284900,289470,the introduction of certain conditions into a controlled environment that stimulates key 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_63,289470,292520,characteristic of a natural environment. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_64,292520,299529,An example might be to the examining the extent to which the responses of a group of voters 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_65,299529,306499,to question about political attitude after exposure to a series of party election broadcast 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_66,306499,313020,might be different from another yet identical groups response when it has not been confronted 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_67,313020,314800,with such images. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_68,314800,320309,"Such experiments allow for very considerable control on behalf of the researcher, who is "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_69,320309,327410,able to effect change and observe research participant’s subsequent behavior. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_70,327410,331759,Experiments conducted outside the laboratory take place in a natural environment under 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_71,331759,334849,as carefully controlled condition as possible. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_72,334849,341999,An example might be a situation in which researcher stage a physical attack in a public place 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_73,341999,348499,to examine people's response to the incident as an investigation of a bystander apathy. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_74,348499,350939,Field experiments are somewhat different. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_75,350939,356819,"Here, experiment principles are applied to live social events and therefore permits the "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_76,356819,361120,"study of phenomenon, which ethical or practical consideration would normally rule out. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_77,361120,368690,"Essentially, the researcher measure the effect of an intervention which is occurring naturally. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_78,368690,374930,"Such projects, which measure variables without manipulating them are often called quasi-experiment "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_79,374930,378000,or non-experimental designs. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_80,378000,383430,An example might be a comparison of voter turnout for local election in two different 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_81,383430,388999,"areas, one where a new initiative has been introduced by a local authority, voting by "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_82,388999,392089,telephone and one where it has not. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_83,392089,397039,The role of the researcher will be to measure any change in the voting levels that allow 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_84,397039,402759,"from the initiative, to examine whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_85,402759,409139,the two variables which is in that case are voting methods and voter turnout rate. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_86,409139,414379,Establishing causality – Experimental research is based on testing a hypothesis stating a 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_87,414379,419319,relationship between a dependentable variable and an independent variable. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_88,419319,423680,A dependable variable is the variable that the researcher wishes to explain. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_89,423680,428289,"And an ind… independent variable is the variable, the variable that researcher expects "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_90,428289,431759,to explain the change in the dependable variable. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_91,431759,438180,"If we can determine that the two variables or phenomenon vary, then we can say that we "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_92,438180,441719,have established a ka… co-variation. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_93,441719,449279,"For example, we may be able to establish co-variation between personal income and political conservatism. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_94,449279,455189,"However, simply being also able to say that a change in the level of income is associated "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_95,455189,461409,with the change in conservatism is rather limited in terms of scientific explanation. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_96,461409,467150,"In the majority of cases, researchers will want to go beyond co-variation to demo… "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_97,467150,472899,demonstrate causality that a change in the independent variable causes a change in the 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_98,472899,474219,dependent variable. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_99,474219,481379,"To be able to establish causality, it must be possible to establish the time order of "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_100,481379,484460,"event, that the effect follows the cause. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_101,484460,489289,"In the natural sciences where the experiments are carried out under highly controlled condition, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_102,489289,494589,the verification of causality is not particularly problematic. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_103,494589,500949,"For example, it is relatively straightforward to determine that the application of heat "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_104,500949,503659,to water causes it to boil. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_105,503659,509250,"However, in the social world we are often faced with co-varying relationship where causality "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_106,509250,510919,is far from clear-cut. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_107,510919,518430,"To return to our example of income and political conservatism, it is possible to argue that "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_108,518430,522110,either of the variable may cause the other. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_109,522110,529750,"As person's income increases, they become more conservatives in both outlook and behavior. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_110,529750,535110,"If a person adopts conservative values and lifestyle, they are likely to see an increase "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_111,535110,536839,in their income. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_112,536839,543610,"The chain of causality in the example is difficult to establish, even though covariation is relatively "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_113,543610,544720,easy to identify. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_114,544720,552170,Even where we can demonstrate a clear covariation between two variables and we are capable of 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_115,552170,557930,"asserting that one predates the other, we do not necessarily have sufficient condition "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_116,557930,559740,in which to infer causality. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_117,559740,565920,Other variable must first be ruled out for this to be the case. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_118,565920,571610,"For example, it would be a weak explanation of the relationship between these two phenomena "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_119,571610,573920,that did not take into account age. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_120,573920,581750,It may be that a person's age is a major determinant factor in relation to both people’s political 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_121,581750,586300,views and the level of personal income that they are able to earn. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_122,586300,592300,"Where a causal relationship between two variables could possibly be explained by a third variable, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_123,592300,596170,we can say that relationship is a spurious one. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_124,596170,604579,"Thus, researcher seeks to establish non-spuriousness that causality is not violated by the existence "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_125,604579,606459,of another variable. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_126,606459,612899,"The steps to be taken when conducting in a, an experiment are, one, determine the dependent "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_127,612899,616350,variable and independent variable in your research. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_128,616350,621529,Choose the level of treatment to be adapted that is what test to use and how often it 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_129,621529,622690,is to be conducted. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_130,622690,627930,"Then, third, draw a representative sample from your target population. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_131,627930,633389,"Fourth, impose as many controls as are possible on other parameters that could affect the "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_132,633389,634910,conditions of the experiment. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_133,634910,641440,Divide the research participants into an experimental group and a controlled group. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_134,641440,646940,Protest both the experimental group and the control group using an appropriate instrument. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_135,646940,650440,Expose the experimental group to the treatment. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_136,650440,655810,Measure both the experimental and control group again using the same instrument. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_137,655810,661069,Collect data from both the pre-testing and post-testing of both groups. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_138,661069,666750,Analyze data to determine the effects of the treatment on the experimental group. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_139,666750,671910,"Now, let’s discuss the issues in conducting the experimental research. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_140,671910,678190,All experiments are subject to threat to their validity in ways that may severely detract 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_141,678190,679950,from the findings. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_142,679950,685060,These are expressed in terms of threats to an experiment's internal validity that is 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_143,685060,690399,those things that may affect whether a true measurement has been obtained using the measuring 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_144,690399,696620,instrument and threats to external validity that is concerning the generalizability of 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_145,696620,700170,the findings to the intended population. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_146,700170,705510,Internal Validity – History events that may occur in society between the first and 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_147,705510,709740,the second measurements which could explain the change in the dependable variable. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_148,709740,715790,"For example, in carrying out an experiment on workplace morale something may happen in "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_149,715790,721079,the experimental group’s workplace and not in the control group’s workplace. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_150,721079,727019,Even outside influence such as particular good or bad whether most definitely outside 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_151,727019,732160,"the control of the experimenter may impact on, have a impact on the experiment. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_152,732160,737829,The next point that needs to be taken care of is the maturation. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_153,737829,743670,Other processes that may be influenced by the passage of time between the two tests. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_154,743670,749390,The obviously dependent on the time that elapse between the pre-test and the post-test. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_155,749390,755459,"Where the gap is a considerable one, a variety of factors including personal life events "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_156,755459,757370,may need to be taken into account. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_157,757370,759620,Third is the mortality. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_158,759620,765250,This happens when some of the experimental or control group leave the experiment thus 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_159,765250,767839,affecting the two groups comparability. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_160,767839,773560,"Again, this will be a function of the length of the experiment and will be more of an issue "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_161,773560,777689,where the experiment takes place over a longer period. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_162,777689,779709,Forth one is the instrumentation. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_163,779709,784430,Any variation in the test whether between the two groups or over the two tests. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_164,784430,790360,It will be very important to ensure that the same instrument is used for both the pre-test 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_165,790360,792100,and the post-test. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_166,792100,797680,"If this is not the case, then the observed difference could be the result of variation "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_167,797680,800029,in a measurement process. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_168,800029,805120,"Testing the final point, the possibility that the test itself may explain the change in "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_169,805120,807040,the dependable variability. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_170,807040,812220,"For example, in the course of carrying out an experiment on the extent to which exposure "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_171,812220,817920,to a party election broadcast might affect the level of people's political knowledge. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_172,817920,824339,The very act of actually taking part in the experiment itself might affect people's test score. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_173,824339,831279,It might get them into the mode of being tested perhaps by relieving any pre-test nerves and 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_174,831279,833569,increasing their general pre-test level of confidence. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_175,833569,839899,"If this is the case, it is possible that any changed record may actually be the result "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_176,839899,847240,"of your conducting the research, not of showing them the party election broadcast. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_177,847240,849230,Next is external validity. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_178,849230,854399,The main threat to external validity is that the knowledge that people are participating 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_179,854399,859300,in a study is likely to impact on the behavior of the researcher participants. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_180,859300,865540,"If, for example, the people in the study know that you are observing them to see whether "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_181,865540,872430,"their morale has improved after the introduction of a new management initiative, they may deliberately "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_182,872430,874330,act in a particular way. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_183,874330,877500,This is known as the problem of reactivity. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_184,877500,885589,They may display marked positive or negative reaction depending on the disposition towards their employer. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_185,885589,891529,"This phenomenon has become known as the Hawthorn Effect, after a research product project that "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_186,891529,897550,"was carried out by Hawthorne works in Chicago in the nineteen twenties, where the workers "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_187,897550,900910,in question acted up for the benefit of the researcher. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_188,900910,909290,Reactivity is used as a methodological justification for using a level of deception in experimental research. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_189,909290,913000,Ethical issues in the experimental research. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_190,913000,919720,Experimental research raises a number of ethical dilemmas concerning the manner in which researchers treat people. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_191,919720,926050,"For example, some researcher may consider it inappropriate to manipulate human beings "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_192,926050,931209,in the same way as laboratory animals such as mice and guinea pigs are treated. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_193,931209,937750,An additional ethical consideration in relation to experimental research is the question of 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_194,937750,943350,"including or excluding people from a study in which some way, some may benefit. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_195,943350,949279,"For example, an experiment may be designed to measure the effect that the introduction "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_196,949279,954850,of CCTV has in reducing crime in certain residential neighborhoods. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_197,954850,961779,"In this instance, it may be argued that researchers occupy a too powerful position in being able "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_198,961779,967529,"to decide which area and therefore, which residence will benefit from the experiment "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_199,967529,970060,and which will not benefit. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_200,970060,975660,One way around such a charge of unethical abuse of power by the researcher is to take 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_201,975660,982009,"a change that is occurring any way and collect or obtain statistics from before the change, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_202,982009,985120,during it and after it. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_203,985120,987889,This is known as quasi experiment. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_204,987889,993970,"As we have discussed earlier, there are two types of quantitative research, experimental "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_205,993970,994970,method and survey method. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_206,994970,996399,We have already seen the experimental method. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_207,996399,998870,"Now, we are going to discuss the survey method. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_208,998870,1004370,We have already discussed sample survey in detail in another module on survey method 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_209,1004370,1008820,"and sampling methods, we will try to understand very briefly here. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_210,1008820,1013779,Sample surveys are conducted in order to provide the researcher or the sponsor of the research 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_211,1013779,1020190,"with statistical information, either on a particular issue or problem that needs resolving "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_212,1020190,1025040,or to test the robustness or not of an existing theory. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_213,1025040,1030690,This involves measuring various phenomena and drawing conclusion about any relationship 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_214,1030690,1034589,between them to establish patterns of cause-and-effect. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_215,1034589,1040750,"For instance, in a study of industrial relations we might compare different workplace in terms "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_216,1040750,1048450,of a number of variable that we hypothise are likely to be associated with the industrial dissent. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_217,1048450,1054220,"These might be the size of the firm or organization, the type of industry, the inclusiveness of "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_218,1054220,1060690,"the decision making process, whether the organization is unionized or not, the skill level of the "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_219,1060690,1067000,"employees, the gender mixing within the organization, the balance between part-time and the full-time "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_220,1067000,1072000,"employees, the unemployment rate in the local area and so on. S… "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_221,1072000,1077660,To analyze such relationship and draw widespread conclusion requires the researcher to generate 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_222,1077660,1083870,"large amount of data, so that conclusions can be generalized from the sample survey "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_223,1083870,1088130,to the wider population from which the survey respondents were drawn. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_224,1088130,1094110,In order to have confidence in the results generated from a sample survey and to any 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_225,1094110,1099650,"eliminate or minimize bias, the researcher should aim to maximize the response rate and "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_226,1099650,1106330,"in doing so, ensure that the study is representative of the population group. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_227,1106330,1111870,Sample surveys are a method of gathering information by means of personal interviews or questionnaire. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_228,1111870,1118300,"They are sometimes referred as mass interviews, because they are a way of collecting similar "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_229,1118300,1122700,information from a large number of people at the same time. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_230,1122700,1129540,"Sample surveys are based on standardized approaches, using standardized instruments such as questionnaire. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_231,1129540,1135970,These research instruments employ fixed question and answer formats so that there is a consistency 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_232,1135970,1141380,"of data collection approach, regardless of who is actually asking the question. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_233,1141380,1147381,"The sample surveys therefore akin to a structured dialogue between usually two people, in which "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_234,1147381,1153000,the researcher ask a series of pre-planned standardized questions and the respondent’s 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_235,1153000,1161430,"answer are recorded precisely on a form, and ultimately turned into numbers for statistical analysis.  "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_236,1161430,1165070,"In this way, the studies are said to be quantitative in nature. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_237,1165070,1170220,"Let us now understand the uses of the survey research, which is a very important part of "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_238,1170220,1171700,the quantitative research. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_239,1171700,1177010,Academic researchers conduct surveys to test out various research hypothesis. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_240,1177010,1182130,"For example, they may want to explore the relationship between age and political conservatism "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_241,1182130,1188690,or why is it that some children play truants from school or under what circumstances people 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_242,1188690,1192510,become addicted to gambling. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_243,1192510,1196110,"By gathering statistical evidences, survey research may help to support a particular "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_244,1196110,1202990,theory by shedding light on the connection and association that exist between such variables. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_245,1202990,1208530,"In this way, researchers look for patterns that may explain social phenomena. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_246,1208530,1214010,Academics are not the only people who use survey method as research method. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_247,1214010,1218140,Other users of surveys can be broadly categorized as follows. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_248,1218140,1222880,"One, government and its agencies, voluntary sector organizations and campaign groups use "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_249,1222880,1230410,"survey research to inform the influence of the political, economic and social policy-making process. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_250,1230410,1236910,"Then, business of all sizes carry out surveys in their quest for gaining a lead in the market "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_251,1236910,1241560,for their product by differentiating their product against those of their competitors. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_252,1241560,1247590,"Third, the media and the political parties carry out public opinion polls on voting intentions, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_253,1247590,1251280,partly political leaders and their polity policies. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_254,1251280,1257960,Survey research can be used to obtain multifaceted data from an individual. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_255,1257960,1263930,"On the behavior, straight forward questions on what the respondent has done or is doing "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_256,1263930,1266100,or may doing the future. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_257,1266100,1272460,"For example, it is possible to ask people if they use public transport for certain journeys "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_258,1272460,1275230,or if they are vegetarian. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_259,1275230,1279850,Then there are questions on belief like what people think will happen. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_260,1279850,1282770,What do they believe is true or false? 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_261,1282770,1288260,Do people believe that the National Health Service is safer in the hands of the current 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_262,1288260,1291720,government than it was under the previous administration? 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_263,1291720,1296120,"Then there are questions of attitudes, how people think and feel about certain things. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_264,1296120,1302330,"For example, whether people consider that women with per-school children should participate "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_265,1302330,1303500,in the workforce. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_266,1303500,1305020,Question on attributes. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_267,1305020,1310510,"These are the personal question that concern the characteristics of the respondent, such "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_268,1310510,1315400,"as his or her age, sex, ethnicity, religion and employment status. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_269,1315400,1320980,"As such, these questions have the potential to be viewed as a sensitive question. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_270,1320980,1324580,They are often referred to as classification questions. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_271,1324580,1330240,"By employing a combination of such question in a survey, the skillful researchers open "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_272,1330240,1334750,up the possibility of describing and explaining complex social phenomena. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_273,1334750,1340990,"Now, let us understand the Method of Data Collection in a Quantitative Research. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_274,1340990,1345380,There are four main types of data collection method for a social survey. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_275,1345380,1352270,"First one, the face-to-face interview, where the respondent is questioned in person by an interviewer. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_276,1352270,1359070,The main advantage of this method is that it usually results in a relatively high response rate.  
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_277,1359070,1365310,"Second, however, such interview commonly incurs high cost due to the number of interviewers "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_278,1365310,1371210,"that need to be employed, and it is also argued that the personal interaction between the "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_279,1371210,1375850,interviewer and the respondent can lead to a biased response. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_280,1375850,1380900,"Then in a study that considers questions of child discipline and punishment, it may be "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_281,1380900,1388230,"that respondent will offer the socially acceptable response, the answer that they believe the "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_282,1388230,1390010,interviewer wants to hear. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_283,1390010,1391601,Second is the Postal Questionnaire. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_284,1391601,1396860,Postal Questionnaire are widely used because they are relatively cheap to administer and 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_285,1396860,1401380,they enable coverage of a wide geographical area. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_286,1401380,1406950,"Also given that they avoid direct personal contact, they have the advantage at assuring "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_287,1406950,1410700,a degree of privacy for the respondent. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_288,1410700,1416200,The main disadvantage associated with the Postal Questionnaire is that they perform 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_289,1416200,1419560,poorly in relation to response rate. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_290,1419560,1424420,Telephonic interview – They have become more common in the past decade as technologically 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_291,1424420,1428980,advances have allowed researcher to draw samples with great accuracy. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_292,1428980,1431400,They are very quick to administer. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_293,1431400,1436690,"However, they are limited to researchers who have access to the relevant technology such "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_294,1436690,1440520,as random digital dialing technology to carry them out. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_295,1440520,1447420,Online surveys which are delivered by email or make use of web based form in place of 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_296,1447420,1450290,a questionnaire are now widely used. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_297,1450290,1455660,They share some of the characteristics of postal surveys in that they are inexpensive 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_298,1455660,1461950,"to administer, but may have lower response rate than interviewer-administrator surveys. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_299,1461950,1467420,Access to data – The instant response is sent and being able to draw samples on a global 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_300,1467420,1472830,"scales are also attractive benefits, but the difference between the characteristic as internet "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_301,1472830,1478320,users and non-user can result in internet based samples which are not representative 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_302,1478320,1480570,at the general population. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_303,1480570,1485410,"Once the data have been collected, the researcher have to codified and process the data in a "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_304,1485410,1490260,manner that is becomes presentable in tabular form and charts. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_305,1490260,1493660,It should also become accessible for use for statistical treatment that would tell us about 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_306,1493660,1497340,the different qualities of data. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_307,1497340,1503710,Each of these methods of data collection has its own strength and weaknesses in relation 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_308,1503710,1510190,"to design, cost, and so on, and in crude terms one`s weakness are often the other’s strength. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_309,1510190,1515770,"The method that is selected will depend on the type of population you aim to research, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_310,1515770,1520870,the nater… nature of the research question and the resources at your disposal. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_311,1520870,1525560,Sampling – A very important part of survey method is sampling. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_312,1525560,1529520,Surveys are often referred to as sample surveys because the information that the researcher 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_313,1529520,1536040,"wishes to gather is usually collected from a selected group of people, a sample. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_314,1536040,1541450,It is very unusual for researcher to question all of the people that they wish to study 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_315,1541450,1545730,owing to both times and cos… cost considerations. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_316,1545730,1548670,Sampling has been dealt as a separate module. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_317,1548670,1552470,Here we will have a basic idea about the sampling survey. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_318,1552470,1557640,Sampling is a method that identifies a representative number from a given universe population. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_319,1557640,1560470,There are two basic properties of sample. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_320,1560470,1565110,It should be adequate and it should be representative of the universe. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_321,1565110,1570270,The most crucial point in sampling is to make sure that one's personal values do not influence 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_322,1570270,1572840,the selection process. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_323,1572840,1578590,"In order to keep out the researcher’s bias, various techniques or procedures of selecting "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_324,1578590,1580540,a sample have been suggested. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_325,1580540,1587030,"To take an often used analogy, one does not need to eat an entire fruit cake to gain an "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_326,1587030,1593810,"idea of its taste a single slice will do that, although the larger the slice, the better it is. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_327,1593810,1596250,The same is the case with the sampling method. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_328,1596250,1603090,The researcher will not need to include all members of the target group of his or her study. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_329,1603090,1606640,"A subset will do, providing it has been selected carefully. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_330,1606640,1612500,"However, the usual rule is that the larger the subset selected, the higher the level "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_331,1612500,1616490,of accuracy to be expected in the findings from the sample survey. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_332,1616490,1621880,"Thus, in survey sampling, the margin of difference between the results from the sample and the "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_333,1621880,1627831,population values referred to as a sampling error is attributed primarily to the method 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_334,1627831,1631560,"of sample selection and secondly, the size of the sample. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_335,1631560,1636810,"Methods of sample selection – As we have already discussed sampling methods, here  "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_336,1636810,1641570,I am just going to tell you the names of various sampling methods or techniques. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_337,1641570,1646250,The details of it can be studied in the module on sampling methods. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_338,1646250,1651750,"First, Probability Sampling Methods, second Simple Random Sampling Method, third is Systematic "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_339,1651750,1654940,"Sampling, fourth is Stratified Random Sampling Method. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_340,1654940,1660200,"Then, in Non-Probability Sampling Methods we have Quota Sampling, Convenience Sampling "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_341,1660200,1662380,and Snowball Sampling. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_342,1662380,1666260,The next process of survey research is the design of questionnaire. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_343,1666260,1671350,"A good questionnaire should include a mix of closed, open and scaled questions. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_344,1671350,1677160,"Furthermore, it will take into account the type of data to be collected and the resources, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_345,1677160,1680200,time and money that are available for the study. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_346,1680200,1686100,A good question is also one in which the questions that have been asked are well crafted and 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_347,1686100,1688980,are the product of careful consideration. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_348,1688980,1695510,"In designing the questionnaire, researcher should do their utmost to avoid the many pitfalls "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_349,1695510,1701080,"that present themselves, including the use of ambiguous language, a language that is "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_350,1701080,1707450,"not appropriate for the targeted audience, a prejudice language, a questions which lead "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_351,1707450,1711620,respondent to answer in the way that could result in biased data. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_352,1711620,1717830,Of equal importance is the need to structure the questionnaire so that it aids the progression 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_353,1717830,1719640,of the interview. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_354,1719640,1725150,Asking the question in a relatively logical order enables sensible flow to develop. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_355,1725150,1730950,It should also be borne in mind that overly lengthy questionnaire are likely to put many 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_356,1730950,1733790,people off from the participating in a study.

Module_18_Quantitative_Research_358,1740910,1744740,as well as the language used in the actual questions. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_359,1744740,1746440,Issues in conducting the sample surveys. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_360,1746440,1752100,"While the sample survey is the most commonly used research method within the social sciences, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_361,1752100,1754210,it has been criticized on a number of level. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_362,1754210,1757640,"The first one, the logic of the sample survey. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_363,1757640,1762440,Critics argue that the logic of the sample survey in attempting to isolate causal explanation 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_364,1762440,1765590,between different variables is in itself deficient. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_365,1765590,1772800,"Given the complexity of human consciousness and behavior, critics hold that survey researchers "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_366,1772800,1778790,will not be able to gain access to the process through which people adopt particular views 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_367,1778790,1784890,or act in a particular ways by simply posing a series of highly structured questionnaire. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_368,1784890,1790650,"Thus, collecting numerous items of information about the world of, for example, industrial "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_369,1790650,1796220,"relation, and subjecting these two various statistical test in order to identify which "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_370,1796220,1801850,"variable appears to have the highest degree of association with the key variable, industrial "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_371,1801850,1803120,"dissent, fails to uncover. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_372,1803120,1807370,The history of industrial relation in a particular organization.

Module_18_Quantitative_Research_375,1819340,1822090,introduced by the management of the organization. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_376,1822090,1827470,It may be that it is these very processes that have had the most significant effect 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_377,1827470,1833520,"on industrial relation within an organization, but they may not be revealed in a questionnaire "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_378,1833520,1836570,survey that actively avoids two-way dialogue. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_379,1836570,1840830,Second point is the value content of the surveys. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_380,1840830,1845610,"Another major criticism levelled at survey research is that, far from being an objective "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_381,1845610,1851270,"method for dispassionately collecting `social facts`, it employs techniques which both reflect "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_382,1851270,1856500,"and reproduce assumptions, that the researcher hold about the social world, and in particular "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_383,1856500,1858580,the phenomenon under investigation. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_384,1858580,1864130,"Thus, the structured format of the questionnaire-based study suggest that the researcher has made "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_385,1864130,1870630,"certain choices about the overall research design, the issues which should and by implication "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_386,1870630,1878170,"should not, be raised, and the format of the model of delivery, self-completion forms or interviews. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_387,1878170,1882480,"In this way, critics of the sample survey claim that the study, and its conclusion is "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_388,1882480,1887250,largely a function of the value and presupposition of the researcher. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_389,1887250,1893780,Those who criticize survey from this perspective may advocate that the use of qualitative research 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_390,1893780,1900330,as an alternative in that such method are more likely to let the respondents speak for themselves. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_391,1900330,1903610,"Then, there is a lack of depth or cont… context. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_392,1903610,1909070,"Furthermore, because the question-and-answer employed are highly structured, respondents "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_393,1909070,1915770,are denied the opportunities to elaborate on issues especially those of a complex nature 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_394,1915770,1917970,or to qualify the answer given. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_395,1917970,1924260,"Thus, critics would claim that this failure to gain an holistic appreciation of a respondent’s "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_396,1924260,1931460,"views concerning an issue or phenomenon inevitably results in only partial data, and fails to "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_397,1931460,1937420,tap into the reality which exists within the inner consciousness of the respondent. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_398,1937420,1940660,The understanding and interpretation of questions. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_399,1940660,1946850,"At an epistemological level, the highly structured approach employed in questionnaire based studies "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_400,1946850,1953320,under undermines a researcher’s ability to ensure that the respondent’s understanding 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_401,1953320,1958060,and interpretation of the questionnaire is the is as intended by the researcher. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_402,1958060,1963900,"Obviously, if there is no correspondence between the researcher and the respondent in terms "

Module_18_Quantitative_Research_404,1969710,1972370,"Finally, conducting online surveys. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_405,1972370,1977730,There are number of immediate advantage to adopting web-based surveys over postal service. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_406,1977730,1981670,Perhaps the most obvious of which is the automation of the data collection. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_407,1981670,1987700,"As soon as the respondent submit their answer, the data are ready to be analyze. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_408,1987700,1992730,"This saves time and money, but also enables sample characteristics to be monitored as "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_409,1992730,1997020,"as responses are received in a, in real time. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_410,1997020,2000960,Every speculative analysis may also be carried out. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_411,2000960,2006330,"Completing an online form does, however, requires a certain amount of technical proficiency, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_412,2006330,2012260,which might impact upon a respondent’s ability to… of willingness to participate. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_413,2012260,2017110,Some researcher highlight the lack of conclusive evidence on studies which have attempted to 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_414,2017110,2023190,"compare the response rate of online and traditional surveys, but others say that online survey "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_415,2023190,2029130,"produce more complete data and fewer dropouts, and claim to be contradicts previous evidence "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_416,2029130,2030890,to the contrary. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_417,2030890,2036310,"Whether online surveys do indeed produce better response rate is difficult to gauge, but it "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_418,2036310,2042160,would seem that all of the standard issues already addressed in relation to respondent 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_419,2042160,2047330,"raise such as questionnaire design, salience of the topic, and sending of reminder letters, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_420,2047330,2050760,hold on hold for online survey as well. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_421,2050760,2057080,"In summary, online survey provide useful means of generating a large amount of data at relative "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_422,2057080,2062460,"little cost, but special attention must be paid to the design of online forms and potential "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_423,2062460,2064690,bias in samples. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_424,2064690,2071350,"That said, online research does, through special discussion forum and social networking sites, "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_425,2071350,2076850,"open up an opportunity to access global samples large enough for meaningful analysis, which "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_426,2076850,2078419,might not otherwise be possible. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_427,2078419,2083002,Coming to the last type of survey method is Political Opinion Polls. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_428,2083002,2089830,Opinion polls are the form of a social survey that differ only in terms of the subject areas 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_429,2089830,2091850,upon which they focus. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_430,2091850,2098040,While social surveys are concerned with issues which might broadly be defined as `social 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_431,2098040,2103520,"polls` investigating people's political beliefs, attitudes, opinions and behavior. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_432,2103520,2109500,"In terms of the method employed and general approach followed, opinion polls and social "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_433,2109500,2111360,surveys are broadly identical.

Module_18_Quantitative_Research_435,2119000,2122760,by the different political parties general election is considered to be good. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_436,2122760,2128310,"Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that in this module we have discussed all "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_437,2128310,2133830,"main quantitative method that are used in research, sample survey and experiment. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_438,2133830,2139080,"In particular, we have consider the usefulness and application at sample survey research. "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_439,2139080,2145540,"We have seen that the logic of the quantitative research is to explain social phenomena, why "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_440,2145540,2153050,people behave in the way they do or hold certain views and values by reference to underlying causes. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_441,2153050,2158980,"This, this emphasis on the search for causal connections between different phenomena or "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_442,2158980,2165080,variables tends to steer researcher’s working within this tradition towards favoring highly 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_443,2165080,2171910,structured research approach and techniques such as experiments and questionnaire-based sample survey. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_444,2171910,2176610,"Quantitative approach, while comparatively dominant within the social sciences have attracted "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_445,2176610,2181390,significant criticism at both epistemological and technical level. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_446,2181390,2186470,"Largely, this criticism is levelled at the very structured nature of such methods, which "
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_447,2186470,2192140,is claimed to prevent any opportunity for respondent to seek clarification over the 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_448,2192140,2198390,meanings of question that are asked and in turn to communicate their responses fully and clearly. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_449,2198390,2203850,This is said to threaten seriously the validity of any such research product project. 
Module_18_Quantitative_Research_450,2203850,2209160,Such critics would therefore dispute the extent to which survey research can provide an accurate

Module_18_Quantitative_Research_452,2211330,2217780,"Hope now, the both the method that is quantitative method and qualitative method are clear to "

Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_6,88210,97369,Main object of this lecture is to develop the fundamental knowledge of data collection process by understanding  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_7,97369,103369,of basic techniques and tools used for data collection in research. In every research  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_8,103369,113840,"work, it is essential to collect factual material and data relevant to research. Obtaining such  "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_9,113840,124160,"information require the resources, way and means to collect the information.  "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_10,124160,133100,It is necessary to adopt a systematic and scientific procedure to collect data for research  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_11,133100,145319,"purpose, so that the final conclusion of research can be reliable and valid. It is possible  "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_12,145319,158550,"only by using the appropriate methods, tools and techniques made for the specific nature of research.  "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_13,158550,164540,"Techniques and tools. Techniques are the way to collect data, where the tools works as  "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_14,164540,175700,the means within the technique for data collection. The term technique is basically used as a 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_15,175700,188430,way which is required to proceed any complex task or scientific task. The technique which  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_16,188430,198230,makes that complexity easier for achieving the object that process is called the technique.  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_17,198230,206530,"Similarly, in the field of research there is a requirement of systematic and scientific  "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_18,206530,215609,techniques which can make it convenient for the researcher his work as to the data collection.  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_19,215609,224760,Though the instruments of data collection are available but the researcher should be  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_20,224760,232560,skilled and have knowledge about those tools and techniques of data collection. Data collection  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_21,232560,242930,in legal field is a important task which is somewhere the mixed approach of social science  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_22,242930,253989,and somewhere the approach of normative science have to be balancedly approach in legal research field.  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_23,253989,260769,"Basically the law is a normative science, its sources of study are found in the text, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_24,260769,274780,"authoritative text like judgements, legislations, but its actual working is in the society where "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_25,274780,282590,the principles normative approach arises from the authoritative text and their application 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_26,282590,290200,"comes with the soci,... in real social circumstances. Therefore, the researcher in the field of "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_27,290200,299100,law should maintain its own methodology which includes the basic pattern applying the social 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_28,299100,305390,science approach and maintaining with the distinct feature of legal research. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_29,305390,316380,"The legal research method is performed commonly between two methods, that is doctrinal and "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_30,316380,326870,"empirical. Following any one method between two depends on the decision of researcher, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_31,326870,333200,"nature of research problem and the nature of data required. In these two methods, the "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_32,333200,339900,"data collection method and process differs from one to another. In doctrinal research, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_33,339900,349320,"which is the traditional form of research in legal field is centering only on the texts, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_34,349320,352450,authoritative texts. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_35,352450,361150,"In, even today the doctrinal method is the first choice of the researcher which, because "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_36,361150,370730,it is convenient for them in data collection. The domain of doctrinal research is basically 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_37,370730,380930,"concern the two sources, one is library and second one is the participation. In library "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_38,380930,387210,"research, the legal theories, principles and prepositions of law may be easily referred "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_39,387210,396320,by sitting in the library. And contents of documents can also be found in the books and 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_40,396320,402000,material available in the library and those contents are self satisfactorily evidence 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_41,402000,410020,"as to the existence of any principle, position of law and legal principles in the society. "

Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_43,419800,428930,"in the law books. That is why in the doctrinal method, the library research is commonly preferred "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_44,428930,441480,"to, for the data collection. The sources available in the library methods are basically books, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_45,441480,451350,"journals, reporters, magazines, newspapers or juristic works. Reports of seminars, symposium "

Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_54,509410,518900,with the process of searching material in the library. He should be acquainted and having 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_55,518900,524360,the experience and practice of searching appropriate data and content in the library.   
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_56,524360,535959,For that purpose he can be assisted by the librarian or other persons who can suggest him to allocate  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_57,535959,540930,the material at the certain places in the document.  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_58,540930,549020,"In the present day, the modern approach introduced to the advancement of technology that is the "

Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_94,851570,861620,or some new tools and techniques may be evolved for gathering the information regarding research. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_95,861620,866940,The first technique that is the observation technique which is commonly used in the social 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_96,866940,876570,survey empirical research or interdisciplinary research. If this technique is is required 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_97,876570,887430,especially where the information required for the research is of that nature where the 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_98,887430,894700,researcher should personally participate and observe the phenomena in the real social instances. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_99,894700,900070,It is a primary tool of scientific enquiry which provides the opportunity for first-hand 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_100,900070,907230,information which is directly gathered by the researcher from his observative approach. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_101,907230,916600,"The purpose of observative technique is to study the existing phenomena, where the law "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_102,916600,925029,is the normative science or the behavioral science. The objective of law is to focus 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_103,925029,932990,and control the social behavior. And controlling individual and social behavior is not practically 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_104,932990,941810,"possible unless looking into the reality of the society. With this principle, the observative "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_105,941810,953750,shall method also have the space and importance in legal research but it is not commonly used. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_106,953750,958251,"In observation technique it may be in the controlled or uncontrolled manner, though "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_107,958251,966550,the controlling human behavior is not the easy task. Yet it can be studied in the controlled 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_108,966550,973480,and uncontrolled observation. Uncontrolled observation means where the stimulus or the 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_109,973480,982940,subject of observation is free from any kind of external control or influence by the researcher 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_110,982940,995810,"or on his path. Where the controlling technique, the researcher suggest certain directives "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_111,995810,1005209,"to the researcher, to the subject and he controls the involvement of that research at the time "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_112,1005209,1007720,of collecting data. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_113,1007720,1015420,"In uncontrolled observation, researcher studies phenomena without any interference in natural "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_114,1015420,1021740,occurrence of phenomena. That is why this uncontrolled approach is deemed more authentic 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_115,1021740,1032549,and appropriate for gathering the real research data. And that is why it is considered beneficial. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_116,1032549,1038329,There are some reasons to support this uncontrolled method that is the natural and real phenomena 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_117,1038329,1046910,can be captured by the researcher which is the basic objective of every research to know 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_118,1046910,1054640,the truthiness and reality which is ordinarily takes place in the natural course of life. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_119,1054640,1067029,"With a dynamic social behavior changes from one place and time to another, that is why "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_120,1067029,1076429,it cannot be controlled and uncontrolled position of the researcher towards gathering the data 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_121,1076429,1087110,from the society that is the appropriate method and supportive for the scientific research. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_122,1087110,1098409,This method is considered important for hypothesis point of view on the observation technique 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_123,1098409,1108200,P. V. Young observed that incident have greater importance on research rather information 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_124,1108200,1112779,received from other techniques. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_125,1112779,1118799,"In doctrinal research, the information or other methods choosing empirical research, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_126,1118799,1125950,"the information are not directly received, information is received from distant or indirect "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_127,1125950,1133679,resources. And this is the direct method which does not employ any agent between the researcher 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_128,1133679,1142929,and occurrence of real phenomena which is the subject of research. But the observation 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_129,1142929,1150649,"of social phenomena for the study purpose is a complex situation because the human nature, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_130,1150649,1157330,"culture and pattern of human conduct cannot be controlled, cannot be anticipated that "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_131,1157330,1163409,is why and various the environmental factors may involve in this process. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_132,1163409,1176029,"For the sake of convenient study, according to the involvement of research, circumstances "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_133,1176029,1186070,"thereof, the researcher can further sub-classify the way of his observation as participation, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_134,1186070,1195059,"quasi participation and non-participative method. In participative observation, the "

Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_136,1201640,1208629,environment that phenomena and thereafter he observes the overall occurrence of the 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_137,1208629,1214450,phenomena being a member of that group or society. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_138,1214450,1227509,"If you want to observe the activities of your students in the classroom as a teacher, if "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_139,1227509,1232509,researcher goes and sit as a observer and become the student participate in the class 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_140,1232509,1240340,"as a student, he can better observe the real activities of a students in the classroom which "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_141,1240340,1250289,"cannot be possible to measure in the presence of teacher. In observative method, through "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_142,1250289,1259249,"participation he closely watch the behavior and activity of the group and study them closely, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_143,1259249,1263679,correctly and comprehensively. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_144,1263679,1272210,"Second method that is the quasi participative method, where the researcher participates "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_145,1272210,1280220,in the process for the limited purpose. He does not participate in the overall environment 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_146,1280220,1290609,in its natural process. Observation research does not remain all present to study group 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_147,1290609,1299210,activities. He has to believe on his fellow researchers of the phenomena when he is not 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_148,1299210,1303259,present in the process. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_149,1303259,1310629,"Next is non-participative method. Non-participative method, the researcher does not participate "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_150,1310629,1320039,in that group or society when he decide to observe their behavior. The social behavior 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_151,1320039,1330940,or the group behavior is observed by presenting in that phenomena but he does not participate 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_152,1330940,1341460,"in the subjected activity. He remain limited to the causes of observation, environment "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_153,1341460,1346940,and population or social life of the observed group. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_154,1346940,1354149,"After the observation method, the second method that is the interview. Interview is also a "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_155,1354149,1366799,"commonly used technique in empirical research. Through interview, the researcher enters into "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_156,1366799,1374450,the face to face interaction with the person or group for the purpose of seeking certain 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_157,1374450,1384620,information. By the way interview itself suggests that the internal view of the other person 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_158,1384620,1394049,is observed through this method. The object of interview is to seek the opinion of other

Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_165,1446669,1455039,After his responses and overall observation it is synthesized and certain conclusion is 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_166,1455039,1464379,drawn on the basis of responses given by the interviewee. The purpose of the interview 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_167,1464379,1470720,is to probe the ideas of the interviewees about the phenomena of interest of research. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_168,1470720,1479990,"It is the process to know the opinion, information or observation possessed by the other person "

Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_171,1493159,1502299,But there are certain limitations of this method because the process involved in the 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_172,1502299,1512299,interview method and other factors are also involved that is the interest of the interviewer 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_173,1512299,1523409,"and interviewee, their attentiveness and the personal qualities of the interviewee, his "

Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_175,1531330,1535460,on the basis of information gathered through interview. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_176,1535460,1542419,"Though apparently, it seems that this is the verbal communication but in reality this is "

Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_191,1656840,1658570,given by the interviewee. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_192,1658570,1669629,"Questionnaire is also a most popularly method other than the interview, where the information "

Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_221,1924649,1930940,maybe that unit itself or within that unit and if the relevant information regarding 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_222,1930940,1938840,that unit is obtained from outsider that is external source. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_223,1938840,1945039,"In the case study method, sometimes the researcher has to fetey,... face the conflict if the "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_224,1945039,1953889,information existing and as to any fact from two different sources and one is from internal 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_225,1953889,1960599,"source and other is from external source. In that case, researcher should apply his "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_226,1960599,1968749,own intelligence as a prudent person and he should consider the other factors like the 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_227,1968749,1978490,nature of information and the interest of the person involved who is giving such information 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_228,1978490,1988369,and other considerations on the basis of which he can decide that what information should 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_229,1988369,2002059,"be relied upon. Methods may be understand as a comprehensive study of facts of life, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_230,2002059,2010960,"incidents or episode of life of any person, group, institution, entity for a certain objectives. "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_231,2010960,2017229,"After cases study, the last method that is commonly used is survey method. Survey method "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_232,2017229,2024840,"is commonly used in social science and socio-legal research, where the objective of gathering "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_233,2024840,2031749,"information is to seek the opinion, experience and feelings of the public at large as to "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_234,2031749,2042859,"any subj,... social issue or as to any social or legal policy. Before making any policy "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_235,2042859,2052980,"to apply that policy before the society it is necessary that the opinion of the persons, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_236,2052980,2058550,stakeholders involved in that process should be given opportunity to express their opinion. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_237,2058550,2064109,"The term survey constitutes from two terms, one is ‘Sur’ which means over and ‘Veeir’ "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_238,2064109,2075220,means to see. It means to see over or to look over the information or any opinion which 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_239,2075220,2082859,exists as to the subject matter of a study or as to any policy. The survey is a process 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_240,2082859,2089750,of collecting quantity of facts in the systematic and organized manner to report any social 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_241,2089750,2098420,existence. Status of facts in a certain area of society is studied by the survey method 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_242,2098420,2106599,or social problem is exposed. Where the object of study is to search the information through 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_243,2106599,2116220,"the real experience, opinion of feeling of the public at large on any matter of social importance.  "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_244,2116220,2123500,"After deciding to survey, the next requirement is to decide about the means used for survey.  "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_245,2123500,2135039,"For the survey method, usually the questionnaire or interview or the schedule may be used for this purpose.  "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_246,2135039,2147599,"Before launching survey, the researcher must determine as to his objective "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_247,2147599,2153079,as to the utility of the data information gathered from the survey. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_248,2153079,2158869,The information gathered from the survey is merely the persuasive one have no authoritative approach.  
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_249,2158869,2163500,"Because it is not in the form of any fact, it is in the form of any opinion "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_250,2163500,2172039,as to the existence of fact. Before relying on the data gathered through the survey the 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_251,2172039,2177780,researcher should take other factors also into consideration. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_252,2177780,2183880,"After that survey, the new method which is commonly used that is the scaling method. "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_253,2183880,2189800,By the term itself scaling means to measure something by using any unit of measurement. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_254,2189800,2197150,"Only those facts can be measured which are measurable, which are variable.  "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_255,2258150,2206049,"This scaling technique is commonly used in the quantitative research. There is in qualitative research, "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_256,2206049,2214260,"the facts which are studied are the social attributes, are the personality, behavior "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_257,2214260,2218290,"which cannot be measured, which can on… only be observed. "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_258,2218290,2226140,But the social scientists have evolved the technique by converting the qualitative data 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_259,2226140,2234630,"into quantitative one and certain scales, statistical scales have been designed and "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_260,2234630,2241710,the opinion of the first respondent is taken on the basis of that numerical scale and thereafter 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_261,2241710,2244319,the data is processed accordingly. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_262,2244319,2251010,"After analyzing all methods involved in the data collection, we can say the pivotal of "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_263,2251010,2257190,the whole research is the data collection and the researcher involved in the data collection 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_264,2257190,2264289,process especially in the legal research should be balancedly focused on the necessity of 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_265,2264289,2272440,data and appropriate techniques and tools requisite for that data in the light of objectives 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_266,2272440,2278010,and purposes of research. And the researcher should also be skilled and experienced as 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_267,2278010,2283010,to the administering the particular tool or technique used for data collection. 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_268,2283010,2288960,"Data collection in the doctrinal research are different, There is the data collection "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_269,2288960,2295140,in the empirical research are different. The basic approach in doctrinal research relied 
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_270,2295140,2301260,"on the credibility of information sources, whereas in the empirical research, the researcher "
Module_12_Tools_&_Technique_of_Data_Collection_271,2301260,2309750,"has to rely on his own observation, his tool and techniques used for data collection.  "

Module_34_Citation_Pattern_79,546029,552249,we will discuss about the purpose and importance of citation. Why we should give the citation 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_80,552249,557980,"of the text? Well, to ide..., must, one of the most important factor is to identify the "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_81,557980,559759,source of the work. 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_82,559759,566239,Before starting any academic pursuit a researcher always verify and keen to learn about the 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_83,566239,573459,bibliographical information research could be located and organize the research effective 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_84,573459,579589,"and accurate manner. So, another important purpose is to uphold the intellectual honesty "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_85,579589,586389,and avoid plagiarism. Academic misappropriation is one of the important concern as we have 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_86,586389,593639,discussed in our previous module about the plagiarism in scholarly communication prov… 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_87,593639,601519,"providing proper attribution to the original author is necessary, component of academic writings. "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_88,601519,607249,Providing proper citation to the correct information or knowledge acquired while reading other 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_89,607249,615790,contribution in the related is another important factor to avoid plagiarism and help in maintaining 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_90,615790,623889,"intellectual honesty in writings. Well, one of the important factor is to validate the "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_91,623889,629309,"essence of research. Scholars, the scholarly writings are generally based on the pillars "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_92,629309,636499,of the previous readings and literature reviews on a specific topic. The objectives are to 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_93,636499,642110,"intimate the relevant, accurate and high quality sources are cited. "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_94,642110,649279,In academic writing it is important to track down sources sighted in a form of references 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_95,649279,657759,and noted bibliographies and footnoting to justify the validity and quality of sources 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_96,657759,665279,"used as the base of analysis, discussion and conclusion of the research work done. Now, "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_97,665279,671619,we’ll discuss about the structure of citation. All the academic discipline follow their preferred 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_98,671619,677079,style of citation. The basic structure of citation style are developed on the three 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_99,677079,683290,basic formats. First is parenthetical referencing style. 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_100,683290,690279,"Well, it is a citation system in which citation to the original source are available within "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_101,690279,696180,"the text of the writing. So, in this citation syst… system partial citations are made "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_102,696180,703139,"using parenthesis, for example, author page, we can write the name of the author or page "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_103,703139,709819,"number, so we can, as you can see in the text, we have written in bracket Russell three fifty. "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_104,709819,715740,"Russell is the name of the author and three fifty is the page number or author short title, "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_105,715740,721910,so we can use the short title along with the author and page number like Russell arbitration 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_106,721910,723699,three fifty within a bracket. 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_107,723699,731189,"So, whether the sources quoted directly or rewritten in own words or refers the idea "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_108,731189,740790,from the source used. It investigates the readers to immediately find from where the 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_109,740790,747420,source of information is derived and saves the time used for making footnote and endnotes. 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_110,747420,755279,"So, in this system, alphabetical arrangements, alphabetically arranged references of document, "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_111,755279,762949,"sources are listed at the end as references, bibliographies or work cited. So, there are "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_112,762949,770290,"mainly two types of parenthetical referencing. So, Or we can say parenthetical citation co-relates "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_113,770290,778069,to a source listed in work cited page. Parenthetical references must have the name of author or 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_114,778069,785350,"authors, date of publication and the page number or numbers which is referred in the text. "

Module_34_Citation_Pattern_297,1913929,1918690,"Well, these are some of the examples you can see. Basic citation format of cases under "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_298,1918690,1925369,"rule ten, how to cite a constitution, how to cite a statue using the Bluebook, how to "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_299,1925369,1932760,"cite a book, treaties and non-periodical materials? So, these are some of the format with example "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_300,1932760,1939559,"we, we can see how periodical material could be cited. We have to write the full citation "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_301,1939559,1942480,"periodical including journal, magazine, newspaper, etcetera. "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_302,1942480,1949850,"So, basic citation formats under rule sixteen one one one which explain articles of journals, "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_303,1949850,1958340,"newspaper articles, online newspaper articles, student written work. So, it also contains "

Module_34_Citation_Pattern_305,1964230,1971149,be used as singling term when it's very important to understand when a periodical work is one 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_306,1971149,1977009,"cited, fully, then for subsequent citation we use “id.” or “Supra” in Bluebook. "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_307,1977009,1982610,Like id. if a work cited as a immediately preceding authority with the same footnote 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_308,1982610,1990110,or as the sole authority within the immediate proceeding footnote use id. and mention different page number. 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_309,1990110,1994499,"So, examples are mentioned here. Another term which we can use to use is “Supra”.  "

Module_34_Citation_Pattern_312,2006869,2013009,is OSCOLA it is a Oxford University Standard for Citation of Legal Authority. It is a footnote 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_313,2013009,2019029,style guide to the legal citation which have the autho… authors in many ways. First is 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_314,2019029,2025320,"to maintain the consistency in writing, identifying the author’s source to follow the relevant arguments.  "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_315,2025320,2033090,All the citations appear in the footnote only. The guide is basically designed to facilitate 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_316,2033090,2039340,"citation of authority, legislation and other legal material. The first edition of OSCOLA "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_317,2039340,2046299,was derived by Peter Birks in two thousand and last revised in two thousand six by Timmy

Module_34_Citation_Pattern_320,2058059,2064419,two year or three years. OSCOLA basically designed to provide rules with examples for 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_321,2064419,2070049,"the UK legal primary, secondary sources. OSCOLA was originally designed for in-house use of "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_322,2070049,2076040,"Oxford University but because of its wider use, now it’s largely used by the law school "

Module_34_Citation_Pattern_324,2079010,2085240,"So, we can see the basic citation format of OSCOLA fourth edition. For primary sources, "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_325,2085240,2091419,you can see the examples in the case of case of cases and case law. We have to use the 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_326,2091419,2096929,"italicly, we have to use italic, the name of the case with the unpunctuated italic V "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_327,2096929,2102530,"to separate the name of the adverse party, the rest of the citation should be in roman. "

Module_34_Citation_Pattern_330,2117990,2124520,"including natural citations, we can use component of case including natural citation, case name "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_331,2124520,2129640,followed by natural citation and law reports. You can see the examples in the screen.

Module_34_Citation_Pattern_355,2259270,2265130,"So, viewers in the conclusion we all know that one of the prerequisite of academic writings "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_356,2265130,2273510,is attribution of academic writings to the original content. Writers and the easiest 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_357,2273510,2279230,method of properly acknowledging the source of information used is through adoption of 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_358,2279230,2280720,suitable citation manual. 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_359,2280720,2286380,We have already discussed the importance of citation in scholarly writings and the various 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_360,2286380,2293220,style manuals available to fulfill the objectives of providing proper credit to the original 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_361,2293220,2299140,writer of the piece of the work. Another important reasons for using citation manual is avoid 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_362,2299140,2304610,the plagiarism whether done deliberately or in inadvertently. 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_363,2304610,2310230,Using proper citation manual helps to prepare the checklist of sources of information used 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_364,2310230,2316060,both within the text of the writing and reference list at the end of the writing in the form 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_365,2316060,2321190,"of bibliographical references which reduce the causes of plagiarism. So, in this module "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_366,2321190,2327270,"we have discussed basic style manual used internationally in a field of humanities, "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_367,2327270,2332540,"social science, law and medicines. Various ors… organization and institution has also "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_368,2332540,2339640,introduced number of style manual in the other fields like American Association Society use 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_369,2339640,2341360,in the subject chemistry. 
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_370,2341360,2347170,"Then we have IEEE , Institute of Electronic Electrical and Electronic Engineering called "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_371,2347170,2355119,"IEEE style. Then, we have AMS - American Mathematical Society and many more. So, in summary in the "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_372,2355119,2361369,"module, this module elaborates importance and purpose of citation style to be used during "
Module_34_Citation_Pattern_373,2361369,2367690,the research. It also explained in-text and note system method of attributing

Module_16_Report_writing_0,32090,38940,"I am Deepika Prakash from National Law University, Delhi and this presentation is about Report "
Module_16_Report_writing_1,38940,55129,Writing under the subject of Research Methodology. 
Module_16_Report_writing_2,55129,61780,"In every research, in any field, there are certain basic steps that every researcher "
Module_16_Report_writing_3,61780,69860,has to take. First step that a researcher takes is defining a research problem.  
Module_16_Report_writing_4,69860,78640,Once he defines a research problem he goes on to review the available literature on the topic. 
Module_16_Report_writing_5,78640,84880,After reviewing the literature he goes on to formulate the hypothesis or the research 
Module_16_Report_writing_6,84880,92460,"question as the case may be. Subsequently, he goes on to create a research design for "
Module_16_Report_writing_7,92460,96650,the entire research to be taken forward. 
Module_16_Report_writing_8,96650,104679,"On the basis of this research design, he goes on to collect the data. This data once collected "
Module_16_Report_writing_9,104679,115340,"with the help of various data tools is then processed, analyzed, and subsequently interpreted. "
Module_16_Report_writing_10,115340,124470,"Once the interpretation of data done, generalizations are drawn, the final step in the entire research "
Module_16_Report_writing_11,124470,131600,"process is taken, which is making the report on the research. "
Module_16_Report_writing_12,131600,142030,"Now, what is a report? In every research, there is a research report. This report is "
Module_16_Report_writing_13,142030,151150,"the formal, logical presentation of the research conducted. No research is complete without "
Module_16_Report_writing_14,151150,159030,"a research report. As the culmination of the research investigation, the report contains "
Module_16_Report_writing_15,159030,167490,within itself a logical and coherent explanation of the various stages of the research and 
Module_16_Report_writing_16,167490,173360,how the conclusion was arrived at. 
Module_16_Report_writing_17,173360,180129,Now it is made to convey to the interested per… persons the whole result of the study 
Module_16_Report_writing_18,180129,187780,in sufficient detail and to determine himself the validity of the conclusions that are drawn. 
Module_16_Report_writing_19,187780,194709,The ability to write an effective report is one of the most useful skills a researcher 
Module_16_Report_writing_20,194709,201670,can acquire. The arrangement of ideas and interpretation of the findings is of utmost 
Module_16_Report_writing_21,201670,207170,importance equivalent to the entire research process itself. 
Module_16_Report_writing_22,207170,214180,"Now, what are the significance of a report? The first significance of a report is that "
Module_16_Report_writing_23,214180,223060,"it conveys knowledge to the concerned persons in the field of research. Second, it properly "
Module_16_Report_writing_24,223060,231280,presents the findings for further utilization as well as recommendations. The report further 
Module_16_Report_writing_25,231280,240980,gives impetus to further research in a concerned knowledge area and it helps to reexamine the 
Module_16_Report_writing_26,240980,247879,validity of the generalization drawn by the researcher after the report has been submitted. 
Module_16_Report_writing_27,247879,255719,Now there are various kinds of reports depending upon the object of the report and the area. 
Module_16_Report_writing_28,255719,262740,"There are business reports, project reports, there are dissertations, thesis, there are "
Module_16_Report_writing_29,262740,268960,various enquiry reports. There are also legal research reports. This presentation deals 
Module_16_Report_writing_30,268960,272420,with how a legal research report is written. 
Module_16_Report_writing_31,272420,280500,"Now, what is a legal research report? It is a report which deals specifically with a legal "
Module_16_Report_writing_32,280500,287419,problem. Such a report is not a complete description of the work done by the researcher.  
Module_16_Report_writing_33,287419,296960,It is only a brief statement of the most significant facts that are necessary for the understanding 
Module_16_Report_writing_34,296960,300310,the generalizations drawn by the investigator. 
Module_16_Report_writing_35,300310,309900,"Now, there are some basic guidelines for every report writing. First guideline that a report "
Module_16_Report_writing_36,309900,315389,writer must keep in mind is the knowledge of the research material. The writer must 
Module_16_Report_writing_37,315389,322349,have the comprehensive and adequate knowledge of the research area. It forms the backbone 
Module_16_Report_writing_38,322349,329970,of the entire research process and is of vital importance at the time of analysis and interpretation 
Module_16_Report_writing_39,329970,333750,of report writing. 
Module_16_Report_writing_40,333750,341000,Second guideline is organizing of the research material. The material collected must be organized 
Module_16_Report_writing_41,341000,347770,and the notes made on them manageable and properly arranged with sufficient information 
Module_16_Report_writing_42,347770,355240,which may be required. The research information must be logically analyzed and represented 
Module_16_Report_writing_43,355240,361949,in the correct sequence of time or occurrence. 
Module_16_Report_writing_44,361949,368789,Another guideline for the researcher is that he should do a continuous report reflective 
Module_16_Report_writing_45,368789,375480,thinking. Researcher constantly reflects on the material and the data collected for a 
Module_16_Report_writing_46,375480,384599,"more comprehensive legal report. He should make rough drafts, which will help him with "
Module_16_Report_writing_47,384599,390979,research interpretation and generalization in a more accurate and relevant form and will 
Module_16_Report_writing_48,390979,396720,also help him test the research questions and the hypothesis. 
Module_16_Report_writing_49,396720,403740,Another guideline that a researcher must follow is to rewrite and polish rough drafts.  
Module_16_Report_writing_50,403740,412610,"Careful revision of the drafts helps in checking the development of the arguments in the report, "
Module_16_Report_writing_51,412610,419060,representation of the material as well as the cohesiveness of the entire report. 
Module_16_Report_writing_52,419060,427680,Preparation of the final bibliography- It is essential that from the very beginning 
Module_16_Report_writing_53,427680,433849,"of the research the researcher must maintain a blib… bibliography of the literature read, "
Module_16_Report_writing_54,433849,441650,"consulted, and incorporated in the research process. This bibliography is generally appended "
Module_16_Report_writing_55,441650,448629,to the research project. It should be arranged alphabetically and be divided into various 
Module_16_Report_writing_56,448629,457099,"parts like names of the books, articles, reports, and legislations consulted. "
Module_16_Report_writing_57,457099,463830,Another guideline that the researcher must follow is footnoting and headnotes. The researcher 
Module_16_Report_writing_58,463830,472159,must wherever citing another author’s work make due footnotes or end notes to add authenticity 
Module_16_Report_writing_59,472159,479099,and reference to the report. There are various methods of writing bibliography and footnotes 
Module_16_Report_writing_60,479099,485169,like the Bluebook method which is basically from the Harvard School and the Oscola method 
Module_16_Report_writing_61,485169,488520,which is of the Oxford School. 
Module_16_Report_writing_62,488520,494509,"Now coming to the structure of a report, the following discussion is a of the structure "
Module_16_Report_writing_63,494509,502949,is a general discussion of any report not specifically a legal report. Pauline V Young 
Module_16_Report_writing_64,502949,510819,"summarize the contents of a good report as following. First- introduction, the introduction "
Module_16_Report_writing_65,510819,517730,"must be clear cut statements as to the nature of the study, aims, source of information "
Module_16_Report_writing_66,517730,523310,"must be mentioned, scope of the study must be mentioned in the introduction and this "
Module_16_Report_writing_67,523310,528870,altogether will make an introduction of a report. 
Module_16_Report_writing_68,528870,537580,Second- Brief statement of the working hypothesis which guided the study. Third- Explicit definitions

Module_16_Report_writing_83,640880,645960,"Now coming to a structure of a legal report, which is a topic of our presentation. "
Module_16_Report_writing_84,645960,652430,"A sound legal report contains the following parts. First, there should be a preliminary part, "
Module_16_Report_writing_85,652430,657632,"second, there should be the main body of the report, and third, the references.  "
Module_16_Report_writing_86,657632,662670,Following is a brief description on all three of them. 
Module_16_Report_writing_87,662670,671070,Preliminary title- Here is an example of how the title page should be. The title page is 
Module_16_Report_writing_88,671070,677120,the cover of the report and the first thing that the targeted readers come in contact 
Module_16_Report_writing_89,677120,685080,with. It indicates the main theme or the title of the study. The title should always be appropriate 
Module_16_Report_writing_90,685080,692940,and attractive. The title page may also contain the name of the researcher and the date. 
Module_16_Report_writing_91,692940,698920,Then comes the preface or the acknowledgment. This contains the acknowledgment to all the 
Module_16_Report_writing_92,698920,704500,people whom the writer is indebted to for guidance and assistance. 
Module_16_Report_writing_93,704500,714520,Next comes the forward. The forward involves a brief synopsis and importance of the content. 
Module_16_Report_writing_94,714520,720510,Subsequently comes the table of cases which contains the list of cases cited within the 
Module_16_Report_writing_95,720510,728180,report. Then under preliminary comes the list of abbreviations. These are embodying all 
Module_16_Report_writing_96,728180,736050,"the abbreviations used in the report subsequently with their full forms, then comes in the preliminary "
Module_16_Report_writing_97,736050,740110,part of the report the table of contents. 
Module_16_Report_writing_98,740110,746770,The table of content mentions the major division of the report and their respective page number 
Module_16_Report_writing_99,746770,753530,"and finally comes the table of maps, diagrams, figures, etcetera, if they have been used "
Module_16_Report_writing_100,753530,754910,in the report. 
Module_16_Report_writing_101,754910,763560,Moving on to the main body of the report – The main text provides the complete outline of 
Module_16_Report_writing_102,763560,770920,the research report along with all details. Title of the research study is repeated at 
Module_16_Report_writing_103,770920,776950,the top of the first page of the main text and then follows the other details on the 
Module_16_Report_writing_104,776950,783610,"pages numbered consecutively, beginning with the second page. Each main section of the "
Module_16_Report_writing_105,783610,791270,report should begin on a new page. The main text of the report should have the following sections. 
Module_16_Report_writing_106,791270,797550,"Firstly, in the main body, there should be an introduction. The purpose of an introduction "
Module_16_Report_writing_107,797550,804850,"is to give a background so as to make clear to the readers why the problem, the research "
Module_16_Report_writing_108,804850,813460,problem here was considered worth investigating. Then the main body should contain the methodology. 
Module_16_Report_writing_109,813460,819310,This represents the research design and method used in carrying out the research.  
Module_16_Report_writing_110,819310,828640,"It should give exact meaning of the measurements or terms or variables used, selection of sampling, "
Module_16_Report_writing_111,828640,833310,"universe selected tools of data collection, hypothesis, etcetera. "
Module_16_Report_writing_112,833310,841020,"Next part of the main body is the review of literature. Here, the report writer assesses "
Module_16_Report_writing_113,841020,847630,the important and relevant already existing literature on the problem. The rationale of 
Module_16_Report_writing_114,847630,853670,the review is to develop upon the conceptual framework in the background of the research 
Module_16_Report_writing_115,853670,860480,which will become the source of formulation of the hypothesis subsequently. 
Module_16_Report_writing_116,860480,866880,Next part of the main body is a analysis and interpretation. This is the most crucial part 
Module_16_Report_writing_117,866880,874680,"of the report. In it, the data which has been collected is processed, analyzed, and interpreted "
Module_16_Report_writing_118,874680,882380,and various generalizations and inferences are drawn. There must be clarity and continuity 
Module_16_Report_writing_119,882380,888570,in the presentation of the text and the result that follows in the main body. 
Module_16_Report_writing_120,888570,894081,The next part of the main body of the report is the findings and recommendations.  
Module_16_Report_writing_121,894081,901770,"Under findings and recommendations, a detailed presentation of the findings of the study with supporting "
Module_16_Report_writing_122,901770,909850,data in the form of tables and charts together with the validation of result is the next 
Module_16_Report_writing_123,909850,913760,step in the writing of the main text of the report. 
Module_16_Report_writing_124,913760,919380,This generally comprises the main body of the report extending over several chapters. 
Module_16_Report_writing_125,919380,927910,"All relevant results must find a place in this report. Towards the end of the main text, "
Module_16_Report_writing_126,927910,934430,"the researcher should aim to put down the research, the results of his research clearly "
Module_16_Report_writing_127,934430,940871,and precisely. He should state the implication that flow from the result of the study. 
Module_16_Report_writing_128,940871,944760,It should then state the recommendations. 
Module_16_Report_writing_129,944760,952000,The next part of the main body of a legal research report is the conclusion or the summary. 
Module_16_Report_writing_130,952000,957300,The main text of the report must end with a summary of the report or the conclusions 
Module_16_Report_writing_131,957300,960360,drawn from the findings. 
Module_16_Report_writing_132,960360,968290,The final part is the references. References have appendices. Appendices should also be 
Module_16_Report_writing_133,968290,975210,"enlisted in respect of old technical data such as questionnaire, sample information, "
Module_16_Report_writing_134,975210,982750,"mathematical derivations, and the like ones. A simple appendix should be headed, appendix "
Module_16_Report_writing_135,982750,989800,in bold and centered on the page in capitals without punctuation and three lines space 
Module_16_Report_writing_136,989800,997880,below the heading. Each appendix is numbered and stated on a new page. Appendices should 
Module_16_Report_writing_137,997880,1005000,be listed in the table of content together with page numbers. Appendices may be placed 
Module_16_Report_writing_138,1005000,1011450,between the final chapter and the bibliography or immediately after bibliography. 
Module_16_Report_writing_139,1011450,1019850,At the end of a legal research report all the consulted sources of data whether preliminary 
Module_16_Report_writing_140,1019850,1027360,"or secondary, references, books, articles, reports, unpublished material, etcetera, must "
Module_16_Report_writing_141,1027360,1034250,be listed in a bibliography. The purpose of a bibliography is to provide cross-reference 
Module_16_Report_writing_142,1034250,1041949,as well as authenticity to the report. It should always be in an alphabetical order. 
Module_16_Report_writing_143,1041949,1047120,Now the style of writing bibliography depends upon whether there is already a prescribed 
Module_16_Report_writing_144,1047120,1053320,form as in the case of a dissertation or the thesis under a university or the researcher 
Module_16_Report_writing_145,1053320,1060309,can adopt any style. Some of the common ones are the Bluebook which is the Harvard form 
Module_16_Report_writing_146,1060309,1066710,of citation and the Oscola which is the Oxford University prescribed citation. 
Module_16_Report_writing_147,1066710,1074809,Now let’s go on to see how to cite legal material. Now in case of an authored book 
Module_16_Report_writing_148,1074809,1081550,"by a single author, the citation must always be in this sequence, first the name of the "
Module_16_Report_writing_149,1081550,1088049,"author, then the tile of the book, the page number, if referring to a specific page or "
Module_16_Report_writing_150,1088049,1095129,"pages and then the publisher, along with the publisher, the name of publication, the edition "
Module_16_Report_writing_151,1095129,1102470,or the year of publication. Here is an example of it like M.P.Jain’s Indian Constitutional 
Module_16_Report_writing_152,1102470,1106350,Law has been cited here. 
Module_16_Report_writing_153,1106350,1113809,"Coming to citation made of a book written by two authors. Now in this, the sequence "
Module_16_Report_writing_154,1113809,1119519,"must be that the names of the authors are first mentioned, then the title of the book "
Module_16_Report_writing_155,1119519,1126750,"along with the page number, if referring to a specific page or pages, then the publisher, "
Module_16_Report_writing_156,1126750,1135000,"name of publication, the edition, the year of publication. Here is an example of it. "
Module_16_Report_writing_157,1135000,1139759,"Now what happens when the multiple authors, let’s say more than two authors book is "
Module_16_Report_writing_158,1139759,1146940,"being cited, under it the use of term ‘at all.’ is used, the name of the first author "
Module_16_Report_writing_159,1146940,1153139,"is only mentioned and after his name the term ‘at all.’ is written, then the title of "
Module_16_Report_writing_160,1153139,1158410,"the book, the page number if referring to a specific page or pages, and then the publisher, "
Module_16_Report_writing_161,1158410,1166159,"place of publication, edition, year of publication. Here is an example of it. "
Module_16_Report_writing_162,1166159,1174780,"Now, how to cite an edited book? When a book is edited by a single author then the name "
Module_16_Report_writing_163,1174780,1181750,"of the editor is mentioned first along with it in bracket ‘ed.’ is mentioned, then "
Module_16_Report_writing_164,1181750,1187930,"the title of the book, the page number if referring to a specific pages or page, then "
Module_16_Report_writing_165,1187930,1194360,"the publisher, the place of publication, the edition, and the year. Following is an example "
Module_16_Report_writing_166,1194360,1198460,of such an edited book being cited. 
Module_16_Report_writing_167,1198460,1204649,"Coming to case laws – Now, how one cites a case law. In India, we have number of journals "
Module_16_Report_writing_168,1204649,1211440,which report cases in various courts in India. The citation of case laws vary accordingly. 
Module_16_Report_writing_169,1211440,1218450,"However, the broad citation idea is firstly the name of the case is mentioned, then the "
Module_16_Report_writing_170,1218450,1227400,"journal name, for example, AIR Supreme Court cases, then the volume number, the year, the "
Module_16_Report_writing_171,1227400,1235999,"court, and the page number. Following is the example of a case cited in the AIR and in SCC.  "
Module_16_Report_writing_172,1235999,1247370,"This is an example of a case cited from the U S, there the citation is slightly different. "
Module_16_Report_writing_173,1247370,1256160,"Now, how do we cite an act? The act is written in a research report aft… in its full form. "
Module_16_Report_writing_174,1256160,1260309,"That is for example, if we are citing the Competition Act two thousand two, then we "
Module_16_Report_writing_175,1260309,1266009,mention it as the Competition Act two thousand two along with the serial number of the year 
Module_16_Report_writing_176,1266009,1270929,in which it was enacted that is Act twelve of the year two thousand three. 
Module_16_Report_writing_177,1270929,1279080,"Now, when we are citing a report then we mention the authority whose report it is, number of "
Module_16_Report_writing_178,1279080,1285450,"report, name and the year of publication. Like here in the example we have cited a report "
Module_16_Report_writing_179,1285450,1291320,"of Law Commission, so we have written it as Law Commission of India, then the report number "
Module_16_Report_writing_180,1291320,1298100,which is one forty fourth report on conflicting judicial decisions pertaining to the code 
Module_16_Report_writing_181,1298100,1303179,"of civil procedure, the year, and the page number. "
Module_16_Report_writing_182,1303179,1311549,"Now, how do we cite an article or an essay? In a report, an article or an essay published "
Module_16_Report_writing_183,1311549,1318789,"in a journal or a periodical is cited in such a form. First, the name of the author of the "
Module_16_Report_writing_184,1318789,1327549,"article is mentioned, then the title of the essay within inverted commas, then volume "
Module_16_Report_writing_185,1327549,1334480,"number of the journal, then name of the journal in abbreviations and then finally the page "
Module_16_Report_writing_186,1334480,1343940,number and in the bracket the year of publication. Here is an example of this. 
Module_16_Report_writing_187,1343940,1351990,Coming to citation of an editorial from a newspaper- How do we cite an editorial from a newspaper?  
Module_16_Report_writing_188,1351990,1358890,These are cited by firstly mentioning the title of the editorial within inverted 
Module_16_Report_writing_189,1358890,1365460,"comma, the name of the newspaper and the date. Now, here is an example we have written “Short-circuited” "
Module_16_Report_writing_190,1365460,1372919,"Times of India, August two is the date and the year of publication. "
Module_16_Report_writing_191,1372919,1382289,"Now, how does one cite an unpublished work? For example, a thesis of a person, under it "
Module_16_Report_writing_192,1382289,1388120,"the citation is written in such a form that firstly the name of the researcher is written, "
Module_16_Report_writing_193,1388120,1393330,then the title of dissertation or the thesis as the case may be along with the year in 
Module_16_Report_writing_194,1393330,1400870,"which the thi… the thesis was written, then the unpublished Ph.D. thesis needs to write "
Module_16_Report_writing_195,1400870,1406670,the name of the university or the organization. Following is an example of it. 
Module_16_Report_writing_196,1406670,1414659,"Now, how do we cite a website? If the website gives the information as to when it was last "
Module_16_Report_writing_197,1414659,1421799,modified then it must be cited. If not one must cite the date of the visiting of the 
Module_16_Report_writing_198,1421799,1427480,"library. Here is the example of it, in case it has been modified then in the end of the "
Module_16_Report_writing_199,1427480,1434789,citation in the bracket we write last modified on such and such date and in case it has not 
Module_16_Report_writing_200,1434789,1441120,been modified or it is not mentioned then in the bracket we write visited on the date. 
Module_16_Report_writing_201,1441120,1449149,"Now, there are certain precautions that one has to keep in mind while writing a report. "
Module_16_Report_writing_202,1449149,1456749,"Following are these, first is the length of a report. The length of a report varies depending "
Module_16_Report_writing_203,1456749,1464029,"on the nature and type of report. However, the researcher must keep in mind that the "
Module_16_Report_writing_204,1464029,1471011,"report must not be too long otherwise the researcher, the readers of the research may "
Module_16_Report_writing_205,1471011,1473330,lose interest in it. 
Module_16_Report_writing_206,1473330,1477880,Second precaution that one should keep in mind while writing the report is that the 
Module_16_Report_writing_207,1477880,1485840,report must be interesting and engaging. The style and language of the report must be simple 
Module_16_Report_writing_208,1485840,1491370,yet able to maintain the interest of the readers. 
Module_16_Report_writing_209,1491370,1499260,"Next precaution is the diagrammatic representation. The researcher must add graphs, charts, tables "
Module_16_Report_writing_210,1499260,1508659,or the various findings so that reader is able to quickly discern them. Another precaution 
Module_16_Report_writing_211,1508659,1514450,that must be kept in mind by the researcher while writing a report is preplanning of the 
Module_16_Report_writing_212,1514450,1521080,report. Keep the objectives of the research in mind. The researcher must preplan the layout 
Module_16_Report_writing_213,1521080,1527279,"and the structure of the report for it to be in accordance with the nature, scope, and "
Module_16_Report_writing_214,1527279,1529010,finding of the research. 
Module_16_Report_writing_215,1529010,1537369,"Next, it should be grammatically sound. The report must be free from grammatical and punctuational "
Module_16_Report_writing_216,1537369,1546809,"errors. All footnotes, abbreviations, etcetera, must be clearly mentioned. The sixth precaution "
Module_16_Report_writing_217,1546809,1552890,that one should bear in mind while writing a report is maintaining logical flow throughout 
Module_16_Report_writing_218,1552890,1559770,the report. It is necessary for the clarity and better communication of the report that 
Module_16_Report_writing_219,1559770,1565990,there must be logical flow of the subject matter in the report without which it will 
Module_16_Report_writing_220,1565990,1570000,be difficult for the readers to decipher it. 
Module_16_Report_writing_221,1570000,1575759,Another precaution that must always be kept in mind by the researcher is that the report 
Module_16_Report_writing_222,1575759,1584049,must be under all cost original. Every report must strive to be as original in its research 
Module_16_Report_writing_223,1584049,1590600,"findings, styles of presentation, and knowledge building. This contributes greatly to the "
Module_16_Report_writing_224,1590600,1595240,future legal research work in the same field. 
Module_16_Report_writing_225,1595240,1601460,Another precaution that is to be kept in mind is mentioned further implications of the report. 
Module_16_Report_writing_226,1601460,1607860,"Towards the end of the report, the researcher must mention the further implications of the "
Module_16_Report_writing_227,1607860,1616730,"said work like in the policy implementation or let’s say jurisprudential contribution, etcetera. "
Module_16_Report_writing_228,1616730,1622909,Another important precaution to be kept in mind at the time of writing a report is bibliography 
Module_16_Report_writing_229,1622909,1631889,must be comprehensive. Exhaustive bibliography must be mentioned at the end of the report. 
Module_16_Report_writing_230,1631889,1637580,"Another objective, another precaution that must be kept in mind while writing a report "
Module_16_Report_writing_231,1637580,1644320,"is the objectives, nature, technique, and limitations be stated. "
Module_16_Report_writing_232,1644320,1649980,"In the introduction part of the report, the researcher must mention the objectives, scope, "
Module_16_Report_writing_233,1649980,1658029,"nature, technique, tools as well as limitations of the research conducted. This makes the "
Module_16_Report_writing_234,1658029,1663870,report more wholesome as well as accurate. 
Module_16_Report_writing_235,1663870,1670539,"In the conclusion of the report writing presentation, I would like to say that report writing is "
Module_16_Report_writing_236,1670539,1678739,the most important part of research. It is the end product of the entire research activity. 
Module_16_Report_writing_237,1678739,1684670,It communicates to the reader the research that has been communi…that has been conducted. 
Module_16_Report_writing_238,1684670,1692159,The report that has been prepared by him therefore must be always simple and coherent to justify 
Module_16_Report_writing_239,1692159,1700379,"the findings and explain the research substantively. Hence, in this presentation we saw how to "
Module_16_Report_writing_240,1700379,1703039,write an effective report. Thank you.

Module_21_Review_of_Literature_63,417450,422889,"Now, we will discuss various types of literature reviews. "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_64,422889,432180,"Literature reviews is a systematic presentation of previous literatures lit..., related to field of study. "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_65,432180,439419,"The method of literature reviews depend on nature of research problem, sometimes it is "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_66,439419,445720,based on research problems pertaining to different subject areas. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_67,445720,452750,"Literature review are categorized in four categories, these are narrative literature "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_68,452750,462270,"review, systematic literature review, meta-analysis method of literature review, meta-synthesized "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_69,462270,466530,method of literature review. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_70,466530,471550,The first method of literature review is narrative literature review. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_71,471550,478330,This is very general and also called traditional method of literature rev… review. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_72,478330,484659,"Under this method, reviewers generally summarize the body of literature. "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_73,484659,493580,A conclusion on the basis of literature referred is drawn on different subsections of the research. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_74,493580,501469,"The previous related studies and research in the form of research articles, reports "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_75,501469,510000,and monographs are generally collected under this method evidentiary support of the research. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_76,510000,519410,This method is basically used for compiling a volume of relevant literature on a specific subject field. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_77,519410,529190,"The method supports facilities visualize background studies for better understanding, better understanding "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_78,529190,534830,current information signifying new research areas. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_79,534830,544100,Gap between research during the timeline may also be identified for evaluate inconsistency 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_80,544100,547410,in a body of knowledge. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_81,547410,552720,Another method of literature review is systematic literature review. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_82,552720,559030,"Systematic literature review starts with foundatio..., formulation of the research questions. "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_83,559030,567000,It is designed and formulated on the basis of answers of the questions formulated on 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_84,567000,570280,the basis of specific subject field. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_85,570280,581890,It is known as well-defined approach of literature review due to its clinical approach or of 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_86,581890,589920,reviewing previous research work in the same field on specific research area. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_87,589920,598040,System… systematic literature review involves a formulated crit… criteria for assessing 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_88,598040,601870,collecting reliable and valid literature. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_89,601870,610730,Parahoo explains a systematic review as the method which involves a time frame for selecting 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_90,610730,617950,research studies pertaining to a limited period for systematic literature review. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_91,617950,627480,"According to Parahoo, a review must have to follow precise criteria as under. "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_92,627480,635150,Initially it is required to formulate a set of questions based on research problem. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_93,635150,644690,"Criteria visualizing inclusing, inclusion and exclusion to show line of subject field "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_94,644690,646870,have to drawn. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_95,646870,655170,On the basis of questions framed and criteria drawn select literature after checking quality 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_96,655170,658080,is adopted in the review. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_97,658080,669390,"After selected relevant review, the review are analyzed, synthesized and findings are disseminated. "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_98,669390,676110,"The prime purpose of adopting systematic review, literature review method is to facilitate "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_99,676110,685710,a complete list of published or unpublished literature on a particular subject area under 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_100,685710,688100,a given time frame. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_101,688100,696270,"The basic difference between traditional and systematic review is selection criteria, identification "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_102,696270,706670,and critically evaluation and synthesize of literature which is not observed in traditional review. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_103,706670,714060,The next and third method is meta-analysis method of literature review. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_104,714060,719420,Meta-analysis method involves statistical techniques in literature review. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_105,719420,723450,It is a systematic review of literature. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_106,723450,729820,"It involves collection of data from previous studies, comparison involving statistical "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_107,729820,738660,methods and tabulation for showing compari… comparison of data presented in studies of 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_108,738660,742220,a particular timeline. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_109,742220,750910,Pollock and Beck argue that meta-analysis review method is very helpful in drawing conclusions 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_110,750910,759700,and finding patterns and relationship between findings of previous literature based on statistical value. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_111,759700,768210,"This method of studies is very useful in comparison of different studies on same subject area, "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_112,768210,774770,differentiated on the basis of demographical or group involved. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_113,774770,783420,The forth and the last method of literature review is meta-sys synthesize method of literature review. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_114,783420,791450,"Under this method, this method involves comparison of findings of multiple quantitative research "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_115,791450,799320,"studies, the major difference between meta-analysis and metha..., meta-synthesizes method is to "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_116,799320,802970,"use non-statistical techniques in meta, meta-synthesize method. "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_117,802970,814340,The review of literature under the method support identifying common variables and theme 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_118,814340,817000,persisted in the previous studies. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_119,817000,825880,"Pollock and Beck state importance of meta-synthetic method, they argue that method is more reliable "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_120,825880,835960,"for drawing conclusions of each individuals, researcher for formulating new conceptualization "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_121,835960,837250,and interpretation. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_122,837250,842940,"Now, we will discuss key aspects of literature review. "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_123,842940,849570,Literature review is totally different from annotated bibliography and abstract. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_124,849570,854880,Annotated bibliographies generally include bibliographically information with a precise 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_125,854880,860030,summary of giving overview of the document or research paper. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_126,860030,868000,"However, literature review involves details about research problems and conclusions given "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_127,868000,870780,in the research document. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_128,870780,877810,"On the other side, abstracting is another form of summarizing a research work for shorting "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_129,877810,879530,understanding to reader. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_130,879530,886990,Abstracting is performed in data centers to intimate about subject matter of the research 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_131,886990,889780,document but not including conclusion. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_132,889780,900330,"So, we can say that abstracting and abstracting is also differ from literature review process. "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_133,900330,907280,"So, the key aspects of the literature review may be understood as collection of primary "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_134,907280,918910,"sor..., resources like research papers, research reports, monographs, patent, standards and other primary data. "

Module_21_Review_of_Literature_137,935180,943320,Mongon-Rallis and Helen suggest eight step for writing literature reviews based on research 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_138,943320,952320,papers of Galvan J on Writing Literature Reviews- A Guide for Student Behavior Science. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_139,952320,959010,Review of literature is primary step building structure of a research. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_140,959010,967781,"These eight steps are- review citation style, finalize research topic and subtopic, identify "
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_141,967781,977130,"the literature, analyze the literature, summarize the literature in table or concept map format. "

Module_21_Review_of_Literature_153,1043049,1050909,It helps in understanding the subject areas on which literature has to be collected. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_154,1050909,1060820,Topic and subtopics must be selected carefully for tracing right direction of the research. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_155,1060820,1066919,"And the next step in reviewing of literature is identify the literature, this is the most "

Module_21_Review_of_Literature_164,1120440,1128750,of information which gives ways and directions for pinpointed primary resources. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_165,1128750,1136110,Analysis the literature collected is the next step where all literature collected in the 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_166,1136110,1145799,form of research papers or else has been overviewed with a motive to classify the literature on

Module_21_Review_of_Literature_168,1149460,1156620,Literature is further grouped in various sections and keeps separately for better classification 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_169,1156620,1158330,of all subtopics. 
Module_21_Review_of_Literature_170,1158330,1165600,"During analysis process, reviewer must be concentrate on various notes like decision "

Module_28_Case_study_5,14730,17570,Hope other modules have been very helpful to you. 
Module_28_Case_study_6,17570,24070,"So, keeping keeping in view with the other modules, I’ll be discussing with a beautiful "
Module_28_Case_study_7,24070,29470,"method called Case Study method, which is a very important method and which, which will "
Module_28_Case_study_8,29470,33340,give you an in-depth understanding about the Research Methodology. 
Module_28_Case_study_9,33340,38199,"In understanding the case study method, we have laid down some learning objectives- They "
Module_28_Case_study_10,38199,44589,"are, one, to understand the meaning and definition of case study method, to understand the argument "
Module_28_Case_study_11,44589,47059,for and against the case study method. 
Module_28_Case_study_12,47059,52370,We’ll also be und… talking about the characteristics and types of Case Study method. 
Module_28_Case_study_13,52370,57930,"Then we will be designing and analyzing a Case Study and after that, in end we’ll "
Module_28_Case_study_14,57930,63510,be studying about the advantages and the disadvantages of Case Study method. 
Module_28_Case_study_15,63510,68290,And as you know there are so many methods in Research Methodology and when we think 
Module_28_Case_study_16,68290,73490,"about empirical research, we often think in terms of questionnaire, interview schedule, survey, etcetera.  "
Module_28_Case_study_17,73490,78060,But there is a method which is completely different from these techniques. 
Module_28_Case_study_18,78060,80480,The method is called as Case Study method. 
Module_28_Case_study_19,80480,86530,"A ca… a case study method involves the systematic understanding of the information about a person, "
Module_28_Case_study_20,86530,89470,"event, group, nation, etcetera. "
Module_28_Case_study_21,89470,94560,"In other words, it is an in-depth study of a person, event, group, nation, etcetera. "
Module_28_Case_study_22,94560,100380,And it helps in narrowing down the research from a broad topic to a narrower topic. 
Module_28_Case_study_23,100380,104610,"It is not just a data collection technique, but a methodology in itself. "
Module_28_Case_study_24,104610,110310,"A case study uses of number of data collection techniques like oral history, documents, participant "
Module_28_Case_study_25,110310,112990,"observation, and in-depth interview. "
Module_28_Case_study_26,112990,119310,Case study can be focused on an individual or a group or a community or a society. 
Module_28_Case_study_27,119310,124910,"A single case doesn't have to mean just one single person, it might be a family, a social "
Module_28_Case_study_28,124910,126660,group or even a single organization. 
Module_28_Case_study_29,126660,131450,A case study can involve dealing with quite a number of individual actually. 
Module_28_Case_study_30,131450,137989,"For example, a case study may involve interviewing staff in a small but growing computer company "
Module_28_Case_study_31,137989,141860,on the social psychological aspect of managing staff. 
Module_28_Case_study_32,141860,147030,This information could then be used to compare with other org… larger companies in terms 
Module_28_Case_study_33,147030,152329,of how they had tackled staff management issues at a similar stage in their history. 
Module_28_Case_study_34,152329,157870,It is important to determine the area of social life or event that needs to be studied. 
Module_28_Case_study_35,157870,163049,"For example, if you want to study about a family, just interviewing the family members "
Module_28_Case_study_36,163049,167670,might not be sufficient as family mim… members might not give the required data. 
Module_28_Case_study_37,167670,173879,The researcher then need to talk to the members of the neighborhood to get the required data. 
Module_28_Case_study_38,173879,178389,In case studies this becomes important as the interaction with the other members of 
Module_28_Case_study_39,178389,182520,the community will also become relevant data for the researcher. 
Module_28_Case_study_40,182520,185810,Here each case is treated as a single case. 
Module_28_Case_study_41,185810,191760,Researcher like Robert K. Yin defines the case study research method as an empirical 
Module_28_Case_study_42,191760,197260,inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real life context. 
Module_28_Case_study_43,197260,203349,"When the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident, and in which "
Module_28_Case_study_44,203349,206049,multiple sources of evidence are used. 
Module_28_Case_study_45,206049,212159,Researcher have used the case study research method for many years across a variety of discipline. 
Module_28_Case_study_46,212159,217819,"Social scientists, in particular, have made wide use of this qualitative research method "
Module_28_Case_study_47,217819,222819,to examine contemporary real life situation and provide the basis for the application 
Module_28_Case_study_48,222819,226079,of the ideas and extent of methods. 
Module_28_Case_study_49,226079,229870,Case studies often confused with ethnographic account. 
Module_28_Case_study_50,229870,235109,Nilika Mehrotra in the course that she has developed on the field research for IGNOU 
Module_28_Case_study_51,235109,236739,differentiated between the two. 
Module_28_Case_study_52,236739,242040,"She says, “What distinguishes case study from more general ethnographic ro… report "
Module_28_Case_study_53,242040,245799,is the details and particularly of the account. 
Module_28_Case_study_54,245799,251389,Each case study is description of specific configuration events in which a particular 
Module_28_Case_study_55,251389,257989,set of actors have been involved in some defined situation at a particular point of time. 
Module_28_Case_study_56,257989,264090,"In setting out a case study, the analyst must decide in advance at what point to enter the "
Module_28_Case_study_57,264090,269120,ongoing flow of event and at what point to withdraw from it? 
Module_28_Case_study_58,269120,276259,It should emphasize on the theoretical connection between the events rather than the events themselves. 
Module_28_Case_study_59,276259,282070,Any technique can be used for the collection of data and it is preferably to operate with  
Module_28_Case_study_60,282070,287690,"Since, data beyond what is strictly germane to this purpose are redundant. "
Module_28_Case_study_61,287690,293490,"Thus, a case study method is a very important method and it has been used by physician and "
Module_28_Case_study_62,293490,297280,psychologists for many years to examine their cases. 
Module_28_Case_study_63,297280,303050,This method is also used in business and law curricula to help students to bridge gap between 
Module_28_Case_study_64,303050,305860,foundations studies and practice. 
Module_28_Case_study_65,305860,310889,There has been a debate on case study method whether it should be used or not. 
Module_28_Case_study_66,310889,316210,"So, there have been various arguments regarding the use of case study as a method or technique "
Module_28_Case_study_67,316210,317930,of data collection. 
Module_28_Case_study_68,317930,321370,Some thinkers argue against the use of case study as a method. 
Module_28_Case_study_69,321370,329250,"According to them a case study method gives a narrow account of the individual, family, situation or event. "
Module_28_Case_study_70,329250,334509,The other set of thinkers are in favor of using case study as a method or technique 
Module_28_Case_study_71,334509,340610,"as it gives a holistic understanding of the individual family, situation or event. "
Module_28_Case_study_72,340610,346879,"To avoid such an argument a researcher can use case study as a method, adding gender "
Module_28_Case_study_73,346879,349169,statistical process to it. 
Module_28_Case_study_74,349169,355909,This way he or she can synergise the two perspective and conduct a holistic research of the issue. 
Module_28_Case_study_75,355909,362050,"For example, a statistical survey might give the information on the quantity of d… of "
Module_28_Case_study_76,362050,367319,the data like how much time children spend watching television or internet? 
Module_28_Case_study_77,367319,374750,"But in the, it is the case study method of the group that will determine why they do so? "
Module_28_Case_study_78,374750,379780,Another important thing about the case study is that it might introduce new and unexpected 
Module_28_Case_study_79,379780,385510,results during its course and just not prove or disprove hypothesis. 
Module_28_Case_study_80,385510,393159,This aspect is important as it leads the researcher  to a new direction and paves way for many new researches. 
Module_28_Case_study_81,393159,399730,"Moreover, case study might not be that much useful in physical sciences, but for social "
Module_28_Case_study_82,399730,402199,"sciences, it is very important method of data collection. "
Module_28_Case_study_83,402199,409810,The case study method makes research more interesting than a purely statistical research. 
Module_28_Case_study_84,409810,415009,"Once we have understood the arguments that have taken against and for for the case study, "
Module_28_Case_study_85,415009,418539,let's also understand some characteristics of the case study. 
Module_28_Case_study_86,418539,424280,"The very first characteristic of the case study is, it is narrowly focused. "
Module_28_Case_study_87,424280,429820,Mostly a case study offers a description of only a single individual and sometimes about 
Module_28_Case_study_88,429820,436560,groups and often the case study focuses on a limited aspect of a person such as the psychological 
Module_28_Case_study_89,436560,439210,symptoms or their experience. 
Module_28_Case_study_90,439210,443220,"Secondly, it combines objective and subjective data. "
Module_28_Case_study_91,443220,448280,"This is the most important characteristic of case studies, because the researcher may "
Module_28_Case_study_92,448280,454370,"combine objective and subjective data and all the data regarded as valid data for analyst, "
Module_28_Case_study_93,454370,458979,analysis and as a basis for inferences within the case study. 
Module_28_Case_study_94,458979,465690,He or she can combine the objective description of behavior and its con… context and details 
Module_28_Case_study_95,465690,471080,"of the subjective aspects such as feelings, belief, impressions or interpretation. "
Module_28_Case_study_96,471080,477499,"In fact, case study is uniquely able to offer a means of achieving an in-depth understanding "
Module_28_Case_study_97,477499,481979,of the behavior and experience of a single individual. 
Module_28_Case_study_98,481979,484630,"Thirdly, it is a descriptive study. "
Module_28_Case_study_99,484630,488289,"The data collected describes the person, group, or family. "
Module_28_Case_study_100,488289,494400,The main emphasis always on the construction of verbal description of behavior or experience. 
Module_28_Case_study_101,494400,497259,But quantitative data may be collected. 
Module_28_Case_study_102,497259,503240,"In doing so, a high level of details is provided, it is an in-depth understanding of the behavior "
Module_28_Case_study_103,503240,506169,and experience of a single individual. 
Module_28_Case_study_104,506169,509120,"Finally, it is a process oriented. "
Module_28_Case_study_105,509120,514979,"The case study method enables the researcher to explore and describe the nature of processes, "
Module_28_Case_study_106,514979,522839,which occur over time in contrast to the experimental method which basically provides a still snapshot 
Module_28_Case_study_107,522839,528680,"of processes, which may be continuing over time, like for example, the development of "
Module_28_Case_study_108,528680,531750,language in children over time. 
Module_28_Case_study_109,531750,537639,"After understanding the characteristics, let's also define the d… various types of case studies. "
Module_28_Case_study_110,537639,541269,"According to Yin and Winston, there are three types of case studies. "
Module_28_Case_study_111,541269,547510,"First is exploratory – In exploratory case studies, fieldwork that is data collection "
Module_28_Case_study_112,547510,551420,may be undertaken before defining research question. 
Module_28_Case_study_113,551420,557400,This type of a study may be seen as a prelude to a larger social scientific study. 
Module_28_Case_study_114,557400,561589,Second type of case study is called us explanatory case study. 
Module_28_Case_study_115,561589,567950,This type of study seeks to explain certain phenomena and is used when conducting studies 
Module_28_Case_study_116,567950,572940,particularly in complex studies of organizations or communities. 
Module_28_Case_study_117,572940,576990,The third aspect is called as descriptive case studies. 
Module_28_Case_study_118,576990,583750,"This type of study requires the investigator to present a descriptive theory, which establish "
Module_28_Case_study_119,583750,588580,the overall framework for the investigator to follow throughout the study. 
Module_28_Case_study_120,588580,596180,"Before beginning research, the investigator must determine exactly what the unit of analysis "
Module_28_Case_study_121,596180,598310,in this study will be. 
Module_28_Case_study_122,598310,605260,When we are designing study we have to keep few points in mind because it is the most important thing. 
Module_28_Case_study_123,605260,610880,"It is very easy to conduct a case study, but it is very difficult to design a case study. "
Module_28_Case_study_124,610880,617779,"So, to design a case study one should keep in mind the subject and the relevance of the subject. "
Module_28_Case_study_125,617779,623170,The first step is to isolate the group or person whom you are trying to study. 
Module_28_Case_study_126,623170,627800,"For example, statistical analysis show that the sex ratio has declined in India. "
Module_28_Case_study_127,627800,634551,A case study of one or two states will help the researcher in determining the social and 
Module_28_Case_study_128,634551,638040,economic reasons responsible for it. 
Module_28_Case_study_129,638040,644519,"Secondly, it is important to plan and design the way you are going to address this study "
Module_28_Case_study_130,644519,648320,and to ensure that the data collected is relevant. 
Module_28_Case_study_131,648320,653610,Researcher has to keep in mind that study is focused and concise. 
Module_28_Case_study_132,653610,660339,The researcher should carry a list of points that he or she is going to try and address 
Module_28_Case_study_133,660339,662279,during this study. 
Module_28_Case_study_134,662279,668420,It will help him or her in ensuring that all research is done around these points. 
Module_28_Case_study_135,668420,675600,"Finally, it is important for the researcher to be passive during his or her research. "
Module_28_Case_study_136,675600,682399,"He or she has to act like an observer, then an experimenter as it will give the researcher "
Module_28_Case_study_137,682399,684690,more information on the issue. 
Module_28_Case_study_138,684690,691930,"How do we, once we have designed the case study how do we analyze a case study? "
Module_28_Case_study_139,691930,697600,The most interesting part about case study is its analysis as it is more opinion based 
Module_28_Case_study_140,697600,699440,then statistical method. 
Module_28_Case_study_141,699440,706010,The data is gathered into manageable form and a narrative is constructed. 
Module_28_Case_study_142,706010,711649,To make the results more interesting try to use examples in narratives. 
Module_28_Case_study_143,711649,718329,While analyzing the statistical data can also be of use but that should not give all the 
Module_28_Case_study_144,718329,721550,results as in case study method. 
Module_28_Case_study_145,721550,728820,The aim of the researcher is n… only trying to judge trends and not analyze every piece of data. 
Module_28_Case_study_146,728820,736860,The analysis should be produced in such a way that a layman also should be able to understand it. 
Module_28_Case_study_147,736860,743399,"A case study is designed to provoke reason debate, and there is no right or wrong answer "
Module_28_Case_study_148,743399,745279,in the case study. 
Module_28_Case_study_149,745279,751160,"Thus, its analyst, analysis paves way for further research, which is an achievement "
Module_28_Case_study_150,751160,754019,for any research and the researcher. 
Module_28_Case_study_151,754019,759971,The case study method with its use of multiple data collection method and analysis technique 
Module_28_Case_study_152,759971,764790,provides researcher with the opportunity to triangulate data in order to strengthen the 
Module_28_Case_study_153,764790,768490,research findings and conclusions. 
Module_28_Case_study_154,768490,777070,"Susan Soy writes, “Specific techniques include placing information into arrays, creating "
Module_28_Case_study_155,777070,785339,"mattresses of categories, creating flow charts or other displays, and tabulating frequency of events.  "
Module_28_Case_study_156,785339,791710,Researchers use the quantitative data that has been collected to corroborate and support 
Module_28_Case_study_157,791710,798580,the qualitative data which is most useful for understanding the rationale or theory 
Module_28_Case_study_158,798580,800480,underlying relationship.” 
Module_28_Case_study_159,800480,807250,Another technique is to use multiple investigator to gain the advantage provided when a variety 
Module_28_Case_study_160,807250,812290,of perspective and insights examine the data and the patterns. 
Module_28_Case_study_161,812290,818949,"When the multiple observation converge, con… confidence in the finding increases. "
Module_28_Case_study_162,818949,826699,Conflicted pers… perception on the other hand cause the researcher to pry more deeply. 
Module_28_Case_study_163,826699,833590,"She further writes, “Another technique, the cross-case search for patterns, keep investigators "
Module_28_Case_study_164,833590,841470,from reaching premature conclusion by requiring that investigator look at the data in many different ways. 
Module_28_Case_study_165,841470,848339,Cross-case analysis device the data by type across all cases investigated. 
Module_28_Case_study_166,848339,851720,One researcher then examine the data of that type thoroughly. 
Module_28_Case_study_167,851720,860620,"When a pattern from one data type is corroborating by the evidence from another, the finding is stronger. "
Module_28_Case_study_168,860620,867380,"When evidence conflicts, deeper probing of the difference is necessary to identify the "
Module_28_Case_study_169,867380,870270,cause or source of conflict. 
Module_28_Case_study_170,870270,876680,"In all cases, the researcher treats the evidence fairly to produce analytical conclusions, "
Module_28_Case_study_171,876680,881550,"answering the origin, how and why research questions? "
Module_28_Case_study_172,881550,886910,"Now, let's understand the advantages of the case study method. "
Module_28_Case_study_173,886910,893110,Searle has talked about the advantages and disadvantages of the case study method. 
Module_28_Case_study_174,893110,897770,She has discussed following points as the advantages of the case study method. 
Module_28_Case_study_175,897770,900259,"One, it stimulates new research. "
Module_28_Case_study_176,900259,907730,"A case study can sometimes highlight extraordinary behavior, which can stimulate new research. "
Module_28_Case_study_177,907730,913370,Some unexpected results from the case study can pave way for the new research. 
Module_28_Case_study_178,913370,918040,It contradicts the established theory. 
Module_28_Case_study_179,918040,921410,Case Studies may sometimes contradict established theories. 
Module_28_Case_study_180,921410,928290,"Searle cites the case study of severely deprived Czechoslovak twins, and the remarkable recovery "
Module_28_Case_study_181,928290,934730,"they showed when placed in a caring social environment as an example of a case study, "
Module_28_Case_study_182,934730,940649,which challenged the established theory of the earlier of life being a critical period 
Module_28_Case_study_183,940649,943730,for human social development. 
Module_28_Case_study_184,943730,947130,Giving new insight into the phenomena or experience. 
Module_28_Case_study_185,947130,951550,Case study gives a new insight into phenomena or expedience. 
Module_28_Case_study_186,951550,957389,As case studies are so rich in information they can give insight into phenomena which 
Module_28_Case_study_187,957389,960620,we could not gain in any other way. 
Module_28_Case_study_188,960620,965050,It permits investigation of otherwise inaccessible situations. 
Module_28_Case_study_189,965050,972240,Searle claim that the case study gives psychological researchers the possibility to inve… investigate 
Module_28_Case_study_190,972240,977839,"cases, which could not possibly be engineered in research laboratories. "
Module_28_Case_study_191,977839,981540,One example of this is the case of Genie. 
Module_28_Case_study_192,981540,988449,This severely deprived child whose case enabled researcher to study the effect of extremely 
Module_28_Case_study_193,988449,993630,social deprivation continued from infancy to puberty. 
Module_28_Case_study_194,993630,999870,To create such a situation for research purpose would be totally unethical and not possible. 
Module_28_Case_study_195,999870,1006980,"But when Genie was discovered by social workers, the use of case study methodology permitted "
Module_28_Case_study_196,1006980,1016070,"much deeper insight into the mechanism, processes and consequences of our experience and recoveries. "
Module_28_Case_study_197,1016070,1019459,We have seen the advantages of the case study methods. 
Module_28_Case_study_198,1019459,1025020,"There are several disvantage… disadvantages of the case study method, which are also described "
Module_28_Case_study_199,1025020,1026040,by Searle only. 
Module_28_Case_study_200,1026040,1031539,She identify the number of dis… disadvantages to case study method. 
Module_28_Case_study_201,1031539,1035100,First one is replication is not possible. 
Module_28_Case_study_202,1035100,1042380,"A uniqueness of data means that they are valid for only one person, while this is strength "
Module_28_Case_study_203,1042380,1048220,"in some forms of research, it is a weakness for others, because it means that findings "
Module_28_Case_study_204,1048220,1049920,cannot be replicated. 
Module_28_Case_study_205,1049920,1054480,"And so, some type of reliability measures are very low. "
Module_28_Case_study_206,1054480,1060309,The researchers on subjective feelings may influence the case study that is researcher 
Module_28_Case_study_207,1060309,1061530,is sometimes biased. 
Module_28_Case_study_208,1061530,1069960,"Both the collection of the data and the interpretation of they, of them is a subjective analysis by the researcher. "
Module_28_Case_study_209,1069960,1076620,"This is particularly true of many of the famous case studies in psychology’s history, especially "
Module_28_Case_study_210,1076620,1079650,the case studies reported by Freud. 
Module_28_Case_study_211,1079650,1085409,"In unstructured or clinical case studies, the researchers on interpretation can influence "
Module_28_Case_study_212,1085409,1092730,"the way that data are collected, that is, there is a potential for researchers bias. "
Module_28_Case_study_213,1092730,1100570,"Third, disadvantage is the memory distortion, the heavy reliance on memory when reconstructing "
Module_28_Case_study_214,1100570,1106970,the case history means that the information about past experience and events may be notoriously 
Module_28_Case_study_215,1106970,1109700,subject to distortion. 
Module_28_Case_study_216,1109700,1115880,Very few people have full documentation of all or various aspects of their life and there 
Module_28_Case_study_217,1115880,1122840,"is always a tendency that people focus on factors which they find important themselves, "
Module_28_Case_study_218,1122840,1127850,"while they may, may be unaware of other possible influences. "
Module_28_Case_study_219,1127850,1133900,"So, keeping all these things they are sometimes very disadvantageous. "
Module_28_Case_study_220,1133900,1138500,"And fi… finally, it is very problematic in generalizing. "
Module_28_Case_study_221,1138500,1144490,Serious problem in generalizing the results of a unique individual to other people because 
Module_28_Case_study_222,1144490,1150890,the findings may not be representative of any particular population. 
Module_28_Case_study_223,1150890,1156809,"Despite having some disadvantage, the case study method is very useful and is commonly "
Module_28_Case_study_224,1156809,1162800,"used in discipline like medicine, psychology, sociology, business and law. "
Module_28_Case_study_225,1162800,1168950,"To understand the case study method, let's take an example of a case study method from the field of law. "
Module_28_Case_study_226,1168950,1177280,"There is a beautiful example given by Epstein, which has been mentioned in IGNOU notes on Research Methodology. "
Module_28_Case_study_227,1177280,1184080,"It goes like this, “While explaining the application of case study method in the field "
Module_28_Case_study_228,1184080,1191270,"of law, Epstein treated law as a problem with which all human groups would appear to be "
Module_28_Case_study_229,1191270,1198520,"confronted, and for which solution must be devised and showed how the case study method "
Module_28_Case_study_230,1198520,1205760,"employed both as a field technique and as a tool of analysis, and applied in different "
Module_28_Case_study_231,1205760,1209100,ways may serve to illuminate these problems.” 
Module_28_Case_study_232,1209100,1215460,"The discussion has concentrated on law as a body of rules, as a set of procedure of "
Module_28_Case_study_233,1215460,1220820,"enquiry and adjudication, and as an instrument of social control. "
Module_28_Case_study_234,1220820,1229950,Epstein makes a further point about law that it may also be regarded as embodying a system of values. 
Module_28_Case_study_235,1229950,1235630,"Moreover, as a social institution, it is, it it is, itself subject to evaluation. "
Module_28_Case_study_236,1235630,1243040,We are concerned here with the basic assumption or postulate that underlying the social life 
Module_28_Case_study_237,1243040,1249799,of a community and the ways in which the task and purpose of law may be perceived. 
Module_28_Case_study_238,1249799,1255570,"To conclude, the case study method is an important technique of data collection. "
Module_28_Case_study_239,1255570,1261140,This method provides detailed descriptive data which is usually qualitative in nature. 
Module_28_Case_study_240,1261140,1266809,"It is also a complex method as sometime it produces large amount of data, which the researcher "
Module_28_Case_study_241,1266809,1269240,is not able to handle. 
Module_28_Case_study_242,1269240,1273670,"Many disciplines use this method to build upon theory, to produce new theory, to dispute "
Module_28_Case_study_243,1273670,1280090,"or challenge theory, to explain a situation, to provide a basis, to apply solution to situation, "
Module_28_Case_study_244,1280090,1285020,to explore or to describe an object or phenomena. 
Module_28_Case_study_245,1285020,1291059,"Thus, in Susan Soy’s words, “The advantage of the case study method are its applicability "
Module_28_Case_study_246,1291059,1298000,"to real life, contemporary human situation, and its public accessibility through written reports. "
Module_28_Case_study_247,1298000,1302950,Case study results relate directly to the individuals everyday experience and facilitate 
Module_28_Case_study_248,1302950,1306529,an understanding of complex real life situation. 
Module_28_Case_study_249,1306529,1311230,"It is in fact, a methodology that gives holistic understanding of a case.” "
Module_28_Case_study_250,1311230,1312159,Thank you. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_0,2639,9670,"Then is the Comparative Rating Scales - Comparative Rating Scale is very important scale, in the "
Module_23_Scaling_2_1,9670,16170,"case of this scale, the position on the rating scales are explicitly defined in terms of "
Module_23_Scaling_2_2,16170,23279,"a given population or a group or in terms of people with known categ..., characteristics. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_3,23279,29460,"Thus, the rater may be asked to specify the comparative ability of a teacher with reference "
Module_23_Scaling_2_4,29460,35140,to the teaching of a college or he may be asked to specify the comparative skills of 
Module_23_Scaling_2_5,35140,39910,"a painter with reference to other paintings example X, Y, or Z. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_6,39910,46190,The comparative ability of the individual or the group in the question may be expressed 
Module_23_Scaling_2_7,46190,49170,in percentage terms by rater. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_8,49170,54750,"For instance, Mr. A is more competent than ten percent of the teacher. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_9,54750,61719,The rater must have a clear knowledge of the ability of the given group or individuals. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_10,61719,67110,Precautions and Limitations for Rating Scales - It is difficult and sometime dangerous to 
Module_23_Scaling_2_11,67110,75700,"fix up rating about many aspects of an individual or overall aspect of, from only one or two known qualities. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_12,75700,81110,There may be some “halo-effect” in the judgement which should be carefully guarded against.  
Module_23_Scaling_2_13,81110,86659,The raters may overestimate the qualities of a known person and underestimate those 
Module_23_Scaling_2_14,86659,88689,of unknown person. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_15,88689,93350,The rater very often do not want to make extreme judgements. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_16,93350,100140,"In the absence of objective standards or definitions different rates, raters may give judgements "
Module_23_Scaling_2_17,100140,102720,on the basis of subjective evaluation. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_18,102720,106810,"Thus, this scale becomes unscientific and unreliable. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_19,106810,112650,The raters themselves must be unbiased and trained. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_20,112650,118250,Then the specification of the reference group and the definition of the attributes being 
Module_23_Scaling_2_21,118250,120689,measured must be objective and clear. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_22,120689,128649,In the case of judgements of complex attributes it is better to use less differentiated scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_23,128649,134849,Several raters giving independent judgment can work as a team and can be very helpful 
Module_23_Scaling_2_24,134849,140760,"in increasing the reliability of ratings, particularly when these are made during the "
Module_23_Scaling_2_25,140760,142990,process of analysis by coders. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_26,142990,149000,"However, the rating scales are very simple and useful to apply irrespective of the method "
Module_23_Scaling_2_27,149000,150209,of data collection. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_28,150209,155750,Rank Order Scale - There is another method of scaling called Rank Order Scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_29,155750,160740,Rank Order Scale is another method of comparative and relative rating. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_30,160740,166790,"In this method, the judge is required to rank individuals in relation to one another. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_31,166790,173150,"When the population is very limited, the judge has to prepare a rank order of individual "
Module_23_Scaling_2_32,173150,176690,from higher in the scale to the lowest. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_33,176690,181950,In a rating scale the individual rater himself may be subject of rating. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_34,181950,184790,This is known as self-rating. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_35,184790,187799,Self-rating has its own advantage and limitations. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_36,187799,194620,"However, self-rating has been found to be useful in measuring the attitudes like intensity, "
Module_23_Scaling_2_37,194620,197120,"importance, liking and so on. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_38,197120,199750,The following two methods may be illustrative. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_39,199750,204440,Paired Comparison - This is a simple method of ranking scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_40,204440,210580,In this type of scale two stimuli are presented before the judges out of which the better 
Module_23_Scaling_2_41,210580,212170,one is to be selected. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_42,212170,215440,The continuum is properly defined. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_43,215440,221220,"The ranks are different types of jobs, for instance, suitable for ladies can be determined. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_44,221220,225700,The investigators can make several pairs of job available. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_45,225700,231379,"The respondents may be asked to point out which of the jobs, two jobs he or she likes. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_46,231379,237950,After all the pairs have been considered any possible inconsistency may be located. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_47,237950,245819,"For instance, if job two is preferred to job three and job three is preferred to job four, "
Module_23_Scaling_2_48,245819,251500,"then by the transitivity axiom, job two is preferred to job four. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_49,251500,258670,"If somebody prefers in this connection job four to job three, his behaviour is inconsistent "
Module_23_Scaling_2_50,258670,262800,and the inconsistent result may be eliminated. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_51,262800,268780,"In this method, the number of preferences of all persons for a particular job is added "
Module_23_Scaling_2_52,268780,273340,and is divided by the number of people who are giving the preferences. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_53,273340,277640,The result that is obtained becomes who are giving the preferences. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_54,277640,283750,The result that is obtained becomes the scale value for the particular job. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_55,283750,289790,"On this basis, score values are ascertained, the scale value is explained numerically. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_56,289790,292630,This method is only a rough and simple method. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_57,292630,298940,"It can, however, be made more meaningful by constructing the paired comparison mat… "
Module_23_Scaling_2_58,298940,304360,"matrix, as has been done by Gutlford in his Psychometric Method. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_59,304360,311590,Next is called the Horowitz Method - Horowitz Method applied a ranking scale for testing racial prejudices. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_60,311590,316720,He took eight pictures of Negroes and four pictures of white children. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_61,316720,322820,These twelve pictures were shown to the school children who were asked to indicate their preferences.  
Module_23_Scaling_2_62,322820,328930,"First preference was indicated by the number one, second by two, third by three and so on. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_63,328930,334760,"Then, separately the scores for the whites and for the Negroes were added and compare. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_64,334760,339960,"In this way, it was possible to know the attitude towards Negroes and whites. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_65,339960,345300,"Needless to say, the smaller the score the greater is the preference. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_66,345300,350960,If all the white children are given the first four preferences the total score would be 
Module_23_Scaling_2_67,350960,357760,"ten is equal to one plus two plus three plus four, but if they are given the last four "
Module_23_Scaling_2_68,357760,364180,preferences the total score would be forty two that is nine plus ten plus one plus twelve. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_69,364180,371470,"So, the possible range for the white children would be from ten to forty two. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_70,371470,377080,The probability of score value would be therefore ten plus forty two divided by two is equal 
Module_23_Scaling_2_71,377080,378770,"to twenty suc..., six. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_72,378770,385390,"If, the actual score is less than twenty six, it would be considered as favourable attitude "
Module_23_Scaling_2_73,385390,390340,and a score more than twenty six would imply an unfavourable attitude. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_74,390340,397790,The same photos can be used for choosing the companions for a variety of situations case by case. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_75,397790,404580,"If there are only five situations, the maximum number of white faces in all the five situations "
Module_23_Scaling_2_76,404580,411610,"say for going to party, for play, for dancing and so would be five into four is to twenty. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_77,411610,418280,"Now, taking twenty as equal to hundred, the percentage of actual number can be calculated. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_78,418280,425300,"Since the number of white faces was four out of five, the probability of selection was eighty percent. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_79,425300,431220,Any increase or decrease in the number may be in favour or against the case depending 
Module_23_Scaling_2_80,431220,433940,on the direction of differences. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_81,433940,440570,Picture tests have been used by many investigators to find out the decisive factors governing 
Module_23_Scaling_2_82,440570,443110,the individual preferences and attitudes. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_83,443110,449970,"Then, we will, let’s talk about Attitude Scale - An Attitude Scale is a very important "
Module_23_Scaling_2_84,449970,451360,method in qualitative research. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_85,451360,456730,"In this type of scale, the attitude of an individual towards the matter, thing, object "
Module_23_Scaling_2_86,456730,462460,or system can be known from the score of his responses given on a questionnaire. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_87,462460,464940,The score will place him on a scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_88,464940,471610,He simply expresses his liking or disliking agreement or disagreement with the issue involved 
Module_23_Scaling_2_89,471610,473840,as given in the forms of questions. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_90,473840,479510,"On the basis of this reply, he assigned a score which indicates his position. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_91,479510,483830,This type of technique is used in a measuring the social attitude. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_92,483830,490190,"In attitude scale, some relevant statements are to be considered by the respondent. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_93,490190,495770,"In attitude scale, some relevant statements are to be considered by the respondent. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_94,495770,501780,The statements are formed in such a way that they are intimately related to the attitude 
Module_23_Scaling_2_95,501780,504090,which is sought to be measured. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_96,504090,508550,Indirectly statements may sometimes be used to reveal the attitude. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_97,508550,515320,"Secondly, the scale should be able to specify the various, but crucial shades of opinion. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_98,515320,521849,"For instance, extreme, moderate and neutral attitude must be expressed through the statement "
Module_23_Scaling_2_99,521849,527420,so that the respondents have several reasonable ways of expressing their attitudes. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_100,527420,534570,"Thus, the method of scale formulation remains very decisive and so is the method of scoring. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_101,534570,541550,"Des..., depending on the difference in these regards, there may be various types of attitude scale. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_102,541550,542550,Let us discuss them. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_103,542550,544640,First one is the point scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_104,544640,550960,"In this scale, at first, a crucial number of words about which the opinion is required is selected. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_105,550960,555540,"The words maybe dowry, eve-teasing, prostitution, divorce and so on. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_106,555540,562430,"The respondent is to cross out every word that is more annoying than the, than pleasing to him. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_107,562430,567050,One point is given to each agreement or disagreement whichever is to be chosen. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_108,567050,572980,"If agreement is to be considered, for instance, each word which has not been crossed will "
Module_23_Scaling_2_109,572980,574800,be given one point. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_110,574800,580580,"According to this method, the attribute of a respondent is known by calculating the number "
Module_23_Scaling_2_111,580580,583500,of words crossed or not crossed. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_112,583500,589100,The word selected should be suggested of an attitude and the opposite words should be 
Module_23_Scaling_2_113,589100,591440,given at the same time. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_114,591440,593720,There may be another variety of point scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_115,593720,600600,"In such a scale, two sets of words indicating both favourable and unfavourable opinions are given.  "
Module_23_Scaling_2_116,600600,606300,"The unfavourable items may be crossed and favourable items may be left. For instance, "
Module_23_Scaling_2_117,606300,611470,if a person scores out of words favouring capitalism and leaves out those favouring 
Module_23_Scaling_2_118,611470,617010,"communism, he can be said to be a communist. Thrus… "
Module_23_Scaling_2_119,617010,623680,Thrustone Scale - Thrustone Scale developed in the nineteen twenties in US generates group 
Module_23_Scaling_2_120,623680,630600,"of indicators of a given variable, say beauty, etcetera that can be empirically used. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_121,630600,635610,The general procedure for this scaling is that a researcher selects a number of relevant 
Module_23_Scaling_2_122,635610,641250,"statements containing a set of caree..., categories agrees or disagrees. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_123,641250,646750,These statements or items are then given a number of judges to order them a continuum 
Module_23_Scaling_2_124,646750,650150,from one to eleven to form the scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_125,650150,655830,The items are selected from each of the ordered category giving preference to the items on 
Module_23_Scaling_2_126,655830,657920,whose ranking the judges agreed. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_127,657920,661930,The procedures involved five steps. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_128,661930,669420,First is composing a large number of statements by the researcher concerning the attitudes to be measured. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_129,669420,674000,"The statement should cover favourable, unfavourable and neutral items. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_130,674000,680870,Each statement should ex… express only one unambiguous idea and be in a form that perhaps 
Module_23_Scaling_2_131,680870,685040,is it to be endorsed or rejected. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_132,685040,689560,Each statement is written on a separate piece of paper. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_133,689560,694210,Ranking items by a number of judges to order them on a continuum. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_134,694210,699000,The least favourable item is given score one and the most favourable item is given score 
Module_23_Scaling_2_135,699000,701750,four or five and so on. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_136,701750,706190,This is called giving a scale value to statement into a number of categories. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_137,706190,714529,According to how favourable or unfavourable the items are to the attitude being investigated. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_138,714529,721340,Each judges rank each item according to the favourable of the items to the attitude usually 
Module_23_Scaling_2_139,721340,723120,in the eleventh category. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_140,723120,729800,"Thus, one item might be ranked in the third category by one judge and in the eleventh "
Module_23_Scaling_2_141,729800,731920,category by another judge. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_142,731920,738870,These items are combined into one master set of eleven categories. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_143,738870,743070,Computing the average scale value median for each item. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_144,743070,747240,This is done by re-grouping the slips by item. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_145,747240,752300,"Suppose, a given item had slips on sets of two, six, eight and eleven. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_146,752300,757410,"All the slips for the, this item are collected and put aside. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_147,757410,762900,"Each item, thus, has a set of slips whose number correspond to the number of judges. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_148,762900,769110,For each item the net tan value is calculated. Selecti… 
Module_23_Scaling_2_149,769110,774780,Selecting the specific scale item that is statements and computing cumulative percentage value. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_150,774780,780860,Testing the relevance of the item that is statements by the researcher and reducing their numbers. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_151,780860,782630,Each statement is identified through scale value. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_152,782630,790310,"The judge asked to rank an individual on a scale of eleven, but thirteen, nine and seven "
Module_23_Scaling_2_153,790310,793880,are also used with the middle category ‘neutral’. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_154,793880,801170,"Generally, the categories are labelled A through K rather than one through eleven so that the "
Module_23_Scaling_2_155,801170,802920,middle category is ‘F’. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_156,802920,810250,"The eleven categories are arranged from A on the left, K on the right, with A representing "
Module_23_Scaling_2_157,810250,814920,"the most unfavourable attitude, F neutral and K the most favourable. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_158,814920,821380,"Here, it is the judges who rank the individuals say on the scale of ‘beauty’ each judges "
Module_23_Scaling_2_159,821380,829380,places each item on one of the eleven categories to represent his or her judgement or how favourably 
Module_23_Scaling_2_160,829380,833350,or unfavourably it represents the attribute to be scaled. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_161,833350,839900,"If the variable authoritarianism, the judges would be asked to assign the scores of one "
Module_23_Scaling_2_162,839900,847890,to the weakest indicator or authoritarianism and the score of eleven to the strongest indicator. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_163,847890,853380,"Once all the judges have completed this task, the researcher examines the scores assigned "
Module_23_Scaling_2_164,853380,859390,to each item by all the judges to determine which item produced the greatest agreement 
Module_23_Scaling_2_165,859390,860700,among the judges. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_166,860700,865500,The items on which the judges disagree would be rejected as ambiguous. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_167,865500,871390,In the variable of beauty a respondent who scores seven to eight might be regarded as 
Module_23_Scaling_2_168,871390,875160,more beautiful than who scores five or less. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_169,875160,881360,"However, Thurstone Scale is not often used today in research because of the time and "
Module_23_Scaling_2_170,881360,885050,energy required to have ten to fifteen judges scoring the item. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_171,885050,890840,It is also not easy to get judges with the required professional skills and experience 
Module_23_Scaling_2_172,890840,892630,on the given variable. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_173,892630,899830,"So, we need Likert Scaling - Likert Scaling is developed in nineteen thirty two and is "
Module_23_Scaling_2_174,899830,905440,used to determine the relative intensity of different items or statements. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_175,905440,911480,"In the summr… summated scale or a Likert scale, if answers to questions are to be ascertained "
Module_23_Scaling_2_176,911480,918080,"only as agree or disagree, one can be sure that he is measuring the same concept, say, "
Module_23_Scaling_2_177,918080,921430,suitability of a boy as future husband. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_178,921430,928550,"But, the problem arises when one cannot be sure that all questions measure the same concept. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_179,928550,935920,"Therefore, developed a technique by increasing the variation in the possible scores by coding "
Module_23_Scaling_2_180,935920,941649,from strongly agree to strongly disagree instead of merely agree or disagree. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_181,941649,949220,The advantage in the Likert Scaling is that it eliminates ambiguity in the ordinary of 
Module_23_Scaling_2_182,949220,950770,the responses category. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_183,950770,957339,"If the respondents were permitted to give answers like sort of agree, pretty much much "
Module_23_Scaling_2_184,957339,964680,"agree, rarely agree, definitely agree, agree very much and so on, the researcher would "
Module_23_Scaling_2_185,964680,971530,find it impossible to judge the relative strength of the agreement intended by the various respondents. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_186,971530,975740,Likert format resolves this problem. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_187,975740,979870,"In forming the item pool, three considerations are important. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_188,979870,985720,"Since the aim of an item is to spread the respondent over the responses category, no "
Module_23_Scaling_2_189,985720,991640,purpose is served by including such item to which nearly every respondent is likely to 
Module_23_Scaling_2_190,991640,993540,respond in the same way. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_191,993540,999460,Since neutral items do not work well in Likert Scale questions which are likely to be answered 
Module_23_Scaling_2_192,999460,1003260,as uncertain or undecided should be avoided. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_193,1003260,1010190,It is advisable to have roughly equal number of positively and negatively worded items in the scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_194,1010190,1013620,Likert Scale is much simpler than the Thurstone Scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_195,1013620,1019870,Likert Scaling does not rely on judge’s opinion and is widely used in professional literature. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_196,1019870,1022680,Constructing possible scale items. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_197,1022680,1028870,The researcher constructs a series of items that express a wider range of attitudes from 
Module_23_Scaling_2_198,1028870,1032240,extremely positive to extremely negative. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_199,1032240,1038829,"In general, eighty to one twenty items are thought to be sufficient, but four items as "
Module_23_Scaling_2_200,1038829,1043250,many items are as needed are generally considered. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_201,1043250,1048390,Each items call for checking one of the five answers. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_202,1048390,1055730,"In terms of strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree or it could be "
Module_23_Scaling_2_203,1055730,1059960,"daily, frequently, occasionally, rarely, never. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_204,1059960,1062870,This is shown in the following example. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_205,1062870,1070340,"First, the retirement age of college or university teachers should be raised to sixty five years, "
Module_23_Scaling_2_206,1070340,1075390,"strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_207,1075390,1080220,"Second, old teachers have more knowledge than the young teachers. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_208,1080220,1084880,"Do you strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_209,1084880,1092790,"Then, old teachers remain more keen to re… to read new articles and books than the young teachers. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_210,1092790,1098340,"Do you strongly agree, agree or undecided, disagree or strongly disagree. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_211,1098340,1106060,Teachers remain as physically and mentally fit at sixty five age as at sixty years. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_212,1106060,1110750,"Strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_213,1110750,1117330,"So, instead of raising the age of retirement, old teacher should be given fellowship for "
Module_23_Scaling_2_214,1117330,1120370,undertaking research or writing books. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_215,1120370,1125540,"Strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_216,1125540,1130700,It will not reduce the chances of new persons being employed. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_217,1130700,1133650,"Strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree, strongly disagree. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_218,1133650,1141390,"So, the questionnaire consist of the above five points with respect to the statements "
Module_23_Scaling_2_219,1141390,1146330,are administered to the respondents who indicate their responses. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_220,1146330,1149880,The respondent will imply various scores as shown above. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_221,1149880,1156670,The scores are consistently arranged either from the higher to the lower or from the lowest 
Module_23_Scaling_2_222,1156670,1158090,to the highest. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_223,1158090,1164420,By adding up the different scores of an individual his total score is calculated that is summation 
Module_23_Scaling_2_224,1164420,1167540,of different scores for different statements. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_225,1167540,1171610,The researcher should identify the items which have a higher discriminatory power. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_226,1171610,1178600,The responses are interpreted to determine which of the statements discriminate very 
Module_23_Scaling_2_227,1178600,1183320,clearly between high score and the low score on the total scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_228,1183320,1187200,It has to be measured that the questionnaire is consistent. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_229,1187200,1194380,"To achieve this, the items with low discriminatory power or those having no significant correlation "
Module_23_Scaling_2_230,1194380,1197370,with the total score are eliminated. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_231,1197370,1204590,The main idea to ensure that every item or statement is related with the attitude which is under study. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_232,1204590,1208860,The Likert-type scale has the following main advantages over the Thrustone scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_233,1208860,1213070,The method of construction of Likert-type scale is less cumbersome. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_234,1213070,1218300,"It is, it supplies more precisely and definite response towards the issue. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_235,1218300,1222230,The intermediate vague points are absent in the scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_236,1222230,1228290,"The Likert scale permits the relevance of several five degree agreement or disagreement, "
Module_23_Scaling_2_237,1228290,1235490,but Thrustone Scale is based on only two alternative responses that is acceptance or rejection. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_238,1235490,1239990,Likert-type scale is more informative and reliable than the Thrustone Scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_239,1239990,1246500,In a Likert-type scale any items or statement empirically consistent with the statement 
Module_23_Scaling_2_240,1246500,1248330,may be included. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_241,1248330,1252760,"Thrustone Scale, only the strictly related items are included. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_242,1252760,1259040,"Thus, Likert-type scale has a border area of reference and has also method of checking "
Module_23_Scaling_2_243,1259040,1264429,internal consistency which is conspicuous by its absence in Thrustone Scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_244,1264429,1268660,"However, the Likert-type scale is not free from defects. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_245,1268660,1273470,The judgement on the basis of total score which is estimated by calculating the mean 
Module_23_Scaling_2_246,1273470,1276240,or median is not scientific. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_247,1276240,1282960,"The total score value maybe the same in many cases, but the attitude may be different towards an issue. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_248,1282960,1288340,"The score on the Likert-type scale may be helpful for making an ordering of the people, "
Module_23_Scaling_2_249,1288340,1294420,but such an ordering will not have any scientific and objective basis. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_250,1294420,1299870,Another defect of the scale is that there is no objective basis for expressing different 
Module_23_Scaling_2_251,1299870,1302420,degrees of agreement or disagreement. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_252,1302420,1309100,"However, despite some limitation it remains an important ordinal scale. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_253,1309100,1313970,"Bogardus Scale - Cumulative Scale or Borgardus Scale is the cumulative scale, a respondent "
Module_23_Scaling_2_254,1313970,1320330,is given a number of questions to express his agreement or disagreement over an issue. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_255,1320330,1325660,The items are arranged in such a way that a respondent who responds favourably to item 
Module_23_Scaling_2_256,1325660,1330920,"number two, also responds favourably to item number one, and one who replies favourably "
Module_23_Scaling_2_257,1330920,1335480,to item three also replies favourably to item one and two and so on. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_258,1335480,1341110,"Therefore, the individual who answers favourably have a higher total score than who, those "
Module_23_Scaling_2_259,1341110,1342910,who answer unfavourably. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_260,1342910,1349100,The score of an individual is computed by counting the number of items he answered favourably. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_261,1349100,1353260,His score indicates for him a particular position on the scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_262,1353260,1357180,The interval between the position may not be equal. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_263,1357180,1363200,The items may be arranged from favourable to unfavourable in a systematic manner or 
Module_23_Scaling_2_264,1363200,1365310,may be randomly selected. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_265,1365310,1369420,The cumulative type of scale was successfully used by Borgardus first. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_266,1369420,1372710,"Thus, it is also known as Borgardus Scale. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_267,1372710,1377790,The main purpose of the social distance scale or Bogardus Scale is to measure the attitude 
Module_23_Scaling_2_268,1377790,1379170,towards a particular racial group or groups. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_269,1379170,1387040,A number of suggested relationship may be listed to which members of an ethnic group 
Module_23_Scaling_2_270,1387040,1388780,may be admitted. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_271,1388780,1393880,The respondent is to indicate as to which racial group is to be admitted by him for 
Module_23_Scaling_2_272,1393880,1396860,each of the specified relationship. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_273,1396860,1401630,The attitude measured by the closeness of relationship that a respondent is willing 
Module_23_Scaling_2_274,1401630,1406000,to accept or the social distance that he likes to maintain. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_275,1406000,1408980,The Bogardus-type scale is can be shown. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_276,1408980,1415460,"Relationship I would accept with, marriage, relationship of marriage, or of friendship "
Module_23_Scaling_2_277,1415460,1421270,or of neighbourhood or of an employment or of citizenship or visited to my country or 
Module_23_Scaling_2_278,1421270,1427120,exclusion from my country for any of the different ethnicity member. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_279,1427120,1432870,"So, the more, if I am okay with a person of a different ethnicity staying in my country "
Module_23_Scaling_2_280,1432870,1437700,and then I give a particular score and I am okay that he should only be visitor to my 
Module_23_Scaling_2_281,1437700,1440720,"country, I will give him a different score. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_282,1440720,1446110,"If he is a cit..., I allow him to be a citizen of my country or he can have employment in "
Module_23_Scaling_2_283,1446110,1450960,my country I don’t mind the person of a different ethnicity being my neighbour or 
Module_23_Scaling_2_284,1450960,1457500,I don’t mind a person of a different ethnicity being my friend and I don’t mind him marrying 
Module_23_Scaling_2_285,1457500,1463540,"in a different kind of community or ethnicity, then my acceptance level is high. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_286,1463540,1468179,The more acceptance there is the less is the social distance. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_287,1468179,1473140,"So, the respondent is to circle each of the seven categories to which he is willing to "
Module_23_Scaling_2_288,1473140,1475419,accept a particular group. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_289,1475419,1479020,The respondent’s first feeling reaction can be known by this. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_290,1479020,1484650,"For a group, if a respondent circles three, he is also expected to circle four and five "
Module_23_Scaling_2_291,1484650,1489840,"for the same group, where three means that he do, do not mind that a person of a different "
Module_23_Scaling_2_292,1489840,1492190,ethnicity is his neighbour. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_293,1492190,1498910,That means he does not mind if he is in pa… part of his country or if he is a visitor to his country. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_294,1498910,1504940,"So, if a respondent does not circle three, he will most probably not circle one and two "
Module_23_Scaling_2_295,1504940,1510429,"that means marriage and friendship, for these indicate even closer relationship. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_296,1510429,1515280,The seven categories indicate a gradual increasing social distance. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_297,1515280,1520179,The fact that the specified items in Bogardus Scale form a cumulative scale is empirically 
Module_23_Scaling_2_298,1520179,1522490,borne out in many countries. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_299,1522490,1527520,"However, some practical reversal may be noticed on a social distance scale. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_300,1527520,1533390,"For instance, a group may not be liked as neighbour, but may be liked as a friend in a club. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_301,1533390,1539480,But these reversals are more possible in individual cases rather than for the group as a whole. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_302,1539480,1545540,The reversal have been found in to be mostly due to the influence of the external factors. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_303,1545540,1550580,"In the Bogardus-type scale, the respondent has to indicate his first feeling. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_304,1550580,1555920,"He has to give his resea..., reaction to each race as a group and he should not take into "
Module_23_Scaling_2_305,1555920,1559820,"account any individual member of a group, best or worst, into account. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_306,1559820,1564900,The social distance can also be calculated mathematically. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_307,1564900,1569559,"In order to do this, weights are attached to different categories of relationship. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_308,1569559,1574919,"Thus, if there are only five categories, the weights such as one, two, three, four, five "
Module_23_Scaling_2_309,1574919,1577140,can be assigned to the first five categories respectively. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_310,1577140,1582390,The following procedure is generally adopted for the measurement of social distance. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_311,1582390,1587950,Place the weight and percentage response for each category in a row. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_312,1587950,1591490,Multiply the percentage responses by its weights. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_313,1591490,1595600,Add up the product and this will be the social distance. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_314,1595600,1601730,"In the Bogardus-type scale, the score does not indicate the exact extent extent to or "
Module_23_Scaling_2_315,1601730,1605680,degree of percentage of a group over the other. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_316,1605680,1612090,"This is, of course, the implicit idea of any ordinal scale as we have stated elsewhere. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_317,1612090,1617720,One important difficulty in this type of scale is that one may not be fully acquainted with 
Module_23_Scaling_2_318,1617720,1622160,the group and hence it is not possible for him to state the attitude. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_319,1622160,1630179,The influence of an individual member or members may not be eliminated from the mind while making preferences. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_320,1630179,1635720,"With the development of the Thrustone and Likert Scale method, attention has been shifted "
Module_23_Scaling_2_321,1635720,1641530,away from the cumulative scale towards unidimensional scaling which seeks to avoid the influence 
Module_23_Scaling_2_322,1641530,1643630,of the external factor. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_323,1643630,1649160,"In fact, doubts have been raised by Carter and other reg..., in regard to the continuum "
Module_23_Scaling_2_324,1649160,1652120,scale as given by Thrustone-type scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_325,1652120,1656549,"Different statements, for example, regarding war in a Thrustone-type scale do not fall "
Module_23_Scaling_2_326,1656549,1657880,along a straight line. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_327,1657880,1662440,"For instance, war is good, war is bad and I do not think about war. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_328,1662440,1666330,These statement cannot make one continuum or a straight line. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_329,1666330,1672150,"When one is combining different and contradictory statements about an issue, it is impossible "
Module_23_Scaling_2_330,1672150,1676059,to specify as to what is exactly being measured. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_331,1676059,1681809,This reaction has given rise to the development of various scaling techniques and the Guttman 
Module_23_Scaling_2_332,1681809,1684640,scale is one such attempt in this direction. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_333,1684640,1690280,"Guttman method, also called as Scalogram - The Guttman scale is based on the assumption that "
Module_23_Scaling_2_334,1690280,1694510,the various attitude statements in the scale belong to the same dimension. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_335,1694510,1701780,The attainment of a high degree of unidimensional is the major concern of the Guttman scale. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_336,1701780,1706330,"However, the Guttman scale belong to the broad category of cumulative scale. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_337,1706330,1712679,"According to Guttman, universe of content can be considered to be unidimensionally only "
Module_23_Scaling_2_338,1712679,1716549,"if yields a perfect, or nearly perfect cumulative scale. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_339,1716549,1722320,A perfectly cumulative or unidimensional scale is hardly possible in social research. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_340,1722320,1728590,Scalogram analysis is a simple method of testing the scalability of the statement. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_341,1728590,1732500,The view of judges are not necessary in this case. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_342,1732500,1737830,A diagram in which individual responses are laid out is called a Scalogram. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_343,1737830,1743320,"In the Guttman technique, the perfect scale implies that a person who answers a given "
Module_23_Scaling_2_344,1743320,1750050,question favourably will have a higher total score than a person who answers it unfavourably. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_345,1750050,1756340,The Guttman scale is analytically complex apart from the fact that there is no guarantee 
Module_23_Scaling_2_346,1756340,1762630,that the various items will scale and even if they do the universe of the content may 
Module_23_Scaling_2_347,1762630,1764810,remain narrow in coverage. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_348,1764810,1770020,This method is more appropriate for scaling ordered behaviour than less structured and 
Module_23_Scaling_2_349,1770020,1771320,broad-based attitude. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_350,1771320,1775030,Guttman model is deterministic in nature. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_351,1775030,1782299,It assumes that a person who response positively or negatively to one item must respond positively 
Module_23_Scaling_2_352,1782299,1784870,or negatively to a series of others. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_353,1784870,1789400,The model can be made probabilistic rather than deterministic. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_354,1789400,1794990,This attempt has been made by “Latent Structure Analyst” as developed by Lazarsfeld. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_355,1794990,1798700,Guttman has developed another technique. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_356,1798700,1803309,"According to this, the respondent not only give his view, agreement or disagreement, "
Module_23_Scaling_2_357,1803309,1809470,but he also mentions the intensity or degree which is classified into five categories. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_358,1809470,1815809,"First, for each respondent we must get two scores that is content score and intensity "
Module_23_Scaling_2_359,1815809,1819770,score which can be plotted against each other on a graph. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_360,1819770,1822170,The result often gives a U-shaped curve. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_361,1822170,1825840,The more extreme views have highest intensity. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_362,1825840,1831520,The content some at the lowest point of the universe may be regarded as the dividing line 
Module_23_Scaling_2_363,1831520,1834320,between favourable and unfavourable responses. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_364,1834320,1837470,The lowest point suggesting favourable. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_365,1837470,1846730,"So, this is how he developed another technique which is also very useful in understanding the Guttman scale. "
Module_23_Scaling_2_366,1846730,1852400,"In this section, we have discussed the concept of measurement and scaling and why there is "
Module_23_Scaling_2_367,1852400,1855650,a need for the these techniques. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_368,1855650,1861090,We have also discussed type of scales which give us an understanding about when and where 
Module_23_Scaling_2_369,1861090,1866600,to use this scaling technique so as to get a correct measurement. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_370,1866600,1872340,"Though, scaling is an important technique, but it cannot completely rely on this for "
Module_23_Scaling_2_371,1872340,1873990,understanding human behaviour. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_372,1873990,1880760,As human beings are more complex than and are normally exposed to more than one stimuli. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_373,1880760,1885929,There is no unique way that you can use to select a particular scaling technique for 
Module_23_Scaling_2_374,1885929,1887320,your research study. 
Module_23_Scaling_2_375,1887320,1892700,"Thank you so much, hope you you have a better understanding of it after this. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_0,350,1750,Hello viewers! 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_1,1750,4759,Welcome to the Research Methodology module. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_2,4759,11980,I hope that you are enjoying the module and gaining lots of benefit out of them. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_3,11980,20400,"Well, I am Dr. Priya Rai, Deputy Librarian and in-charge, Justice TPS Chawla Library at NLU, Delhi. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_4,20400,30100,"Well, viewers, we are going to discuss about very important topic which is primary and secondary data research. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_5,30100,37110,"Well, in this module, we will discuss about what is data and information regarding data "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_6,37110,44979,"collection, various types of data sources, primary data source, interview method, personal "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_7,44979,52210,"method, telephonic method, observation, structured and unstructured observation, participation "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_8,52210,58989,"and non-participation observation, controlled and uncontrolled observation, questionnaire, "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_9,58989,67750,"survey, what are secondary data sources, prerequisite of use of secondary data collection and in "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_10,67750,71030,"the last, we will discuss about the summary. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_11,71030,79189,"Well, in the introduction, data collection is essential process of gathering information "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_12,79189,88219,required based on the research problem or hypothesis framed at the time of formulation of research plan. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_13,88219,97200,"Well, it is a process of gathering information based on certain variable with the view to "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_14,97200,103689,response for the question framed based on the research problem. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_15,103689,113520,"The objective of data collection is to apprehend evidence based on responses, which may be "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_16,113520,119929,transferred in meaning status to answer against the question frame. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_17,119929,129380,"Well, while doing data collection a researcher has to dig written records pertaining to research area. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_18,129380,137340,"These written records may be official publications of government and academic institutions, research "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_19,137340,144970,"finding, historical facts and written records and other non-government information sources "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_20,144970,146820,pertaining to research plan. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_21,146820,150451,"Well, research has to refer various sources of data. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_22,150451,158050,Data may be collected through available material and original data. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_23,158050,165140,It may be grabbed through primary and secondary data sources and bibliographical and field 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_24,165140,172210,data sources are referred where ever available on the basis of requirement. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_25,172210,177910,"Well, we will discuss now about the various type of data sources. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_26,177910,182700,"Well, sources of data are divided into mainly two groups. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_27,182700,188320,First is primary sources of data and secondary is secondary sources. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_28,188320,196690,"A good researcher, planner starts data collection through accessing secondary sources firstly. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_29,196690,203250,Secondary sources give pre-determined and pre-approved directions to research. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_30,203250,211420,"Well, previous research and established facts strengthen the base of research which keep "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_31,211420,217360,research reliable and free from ambiguity. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_32,217360,220570,"Primary data sources, now we will discuss about it. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_33,220570,223290,Data collection is a tedious task. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_34,223290,228490,Researcher must have clarity about the times of data sources. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_35,228490,233770,Primary sources are also called direct sources of data collection. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_36,233770,244620,"Well, primary data plays a very vital role in empirical and experimental research. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_37,244620,254310,Investigator has to formulate questions pertaining to research field before collection primary data sources. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_38,254310,262540,"Primary data is collected through various ways- it may be interview, observation, questionnaire, "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_39,262540,265460,case study and survey method. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_40,265460,268020,We are going to discuss about them. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_41,268020,273900,"Well, primary sources of data collection as you can see in the screen could be interview, "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_42,273900,276010,"questionnaire, observation and survey. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_43,276010,281180,"Well, interview method, now we will discuss about this method. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_44,281180,289120,Interview is face to face interpersonal situation in which one person known as interviewer ask 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_45,289120,298190,"the person being interviews known as respondent, questions, designs to get answers pertained "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_46,298190,301150,to the purpose of research problems. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_47,301150,309970,"Well, interview is a method of collection of primary data by investigator from the respondent "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_48,309970,315560,personally or through any means of communication. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_49,315560,322490,Interview method may further be categorized into various sub methods. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_50,322490,327920,First is personal interview and telephonic interview. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_51,327920,332430,"Well, these are the two categories which we discuss now. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_52,332430,340530,"Personal interview, under personal interview investigators collect responses from respondent "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_53,340530,342230,by personal contact. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_54,342230,350500,"Well, investigator has to formulate a record sheet containing questions pertaining to research. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_55,350500,360750,"Well, face to face questions are asked and recorded by the investigator directly in the record sheet. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_56,360750,369200,Personal interview is the most commonly used an authentic method of collection of primary data.  
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_57,369200,374450,"Then, we have telephonic interview method as well. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_58,374450,381280,"On the other side, telephonic interview is also used to collect primary data, well, respondent "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_59,381280,392060,are connected through telephone for collecting and recording responses against the questions already framed. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_60,392060,400830,Telephonic interview method is used where respondent are resident of distinct places. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_61,400830,409470,"Generally, the respondents are approached for appointment for interviewer under this method. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_62,409470,416669,"Well, this method is used to save time of collection of primary data. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_63,416669,425810,Interview method has a number of advantages in research to collect primary source of data. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_64,425810,430090,Interview is a flexible method of data collection. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_65,430090,439270,It is flexible in asking questions and can be altered as per respondent understanding 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_66,439270,442490,of language and words. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_67,442490,445830,It is a direct method and more reliable. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_68,445830,449810,It is more clear and easy to explain. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_69,449810,458250,Rate of response from the respondent is very high as compared to other methods. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_70,458250,467199,Personal and confidential information can only be collected through interview method. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_71,467199,475940,"Well, a class of respondents that is children, literates and persons with special ability "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_72,475940,482910,and persona… personally disabled are more comfortable to give response through this method. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_73,482910,493070,Interview method is the source of data collection which gives more accurate data response with 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_74,493070,497780,eliminating personal barriers. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_75,497780,504600,"Observation – Well, observation is another method of collection of primary data through "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_76,504600,513330,"watching, noticing, receiving and recording observational facts of a group of population "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_77,513330,519589,or controlled respondent doing some specific nature of activities. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_78,519589,529180,"Well, this method is used to record or observe real time responses by noticing activities "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_79,529180,538519,or respondent of particular subject field or on the basis of area of study. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_80,538519,545029,Observation method may be scientific observation or social science observation. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_81,545029,554160,Under scientific observation various relational responses of chemical and other substances 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_82,554160,557769,are recorded by the researchers. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_83,557769,565819,"Under social science observation method habits, natura… nature, daily routine or working "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_84,565819,571889,style is of a group of responses are observed and recorded. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_85,571889,577910,"Well, observation is a process of acquiring knowledge through the sense of organ that "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_86,577910,587100,"is directly through the sensory organ like eyes, ears, nose, etcetera. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_87,587100,594310,But it is sometimes more as it involves an element of interference also. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_88,594310,603480,"In other word, seeing and looking are purely sensory behavior whereas observation is sensory "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_89,603480,607589,behavior plus intellectual participation. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_90,607589,614790,"Observ… method, observation method of collection of primary data may be categorized in various "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_91,614790,622360,"types, structured or unstructured observation, participant and non-participant observation "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_92,622360,628500,and controlled and uncontrolled observation. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_93,628500,632829,"Structured and unstructured observation – Now, we will discuss about it. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_94,632829,639929,Structured observation method includes already defined parameters and variables which have 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_95,639929,645629,to be observed by the investigator during the course of observation. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_96,645629,654389,"However, under unstructured observation there are no much fixed variables. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_97,654389,664600,Investigators observes the respondents and any behavior activity is recorded during the course of time. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_98,664600,673220,Participant and non-participant observation – A participant observation method involves 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_99,673220,679439,active participation of an investigator in the observed group of people. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_100,679439,689230,"Well, investigator participates in all professional social routine and religious activity of the "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_101,689230,692839,respondent group as active member. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_102,692839,702709,Variables under research problem are observed and noted by investigator with real-time participation 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_103,702709,706999,in the activities of a group under observed. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_104,706999,715769,Under non-participation observation method investigator only investigates the group under 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_105,715769,722589,observation without getting involved in the activities of a group. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_106,722589,730800,Investigator records requisite responses of the group from outside over viewing only under 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_107,730800,734930,non-participant method of primary data collection. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_108,734930,740230,"Now, we will discuss about the controlled and uncontrolled observation. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_109,740230,745800,"Well, controlled observation is another method of collection of primary data. "

Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_287,1866519,1869409,but not only part thereof. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_288,1869409,1876639,Secondary sources selected must be useful to study part of the researcher of full research study. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_289,1876639,1882960,Inadequacy in collection of secondary data results in inconsistency of future result

Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_291,1884460,1890879,"So viewers, in the conclusion, the module has provided detailed overview on various "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_292,1890879,1892240,types of data sources. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_293,1892240,1899169,"It explains various types of pli... primary sources under interview method, personal method, "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_294,1899169,1902760,"telephonic interview, we have been discussed and has been elaborated. "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_295,1902760,1909730,"Well, we have discussed various types of observational method like structured and unstructured method, "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_296,1909730,1915059,participation and non-participant observation and controlled and uncontrolled observation 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_297,1915059,1918759,method for collecting primary data we have discussed. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_298,1918759,1924230,"On the other side, we have discussed structured, non-structured, open ended, closed ended and "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_299,1924230,1928960,mixed questionnaire of primary data collection. 
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_300,1928960,1934759,"And various types of survey method like general, specific, regular, adhoc, primary, and final, "
Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_301,1934759,1938590,census and sample method have been discussed in this module.

Module_25_Primary_and_secondary_312,1983809,1985259,Thank you so much! 
Module_26_Survey_Method_0,580,1899,Hello everyone. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_1,1899,2899,Welcome back. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_2,2899,3899,How are you doing? 
Module_26_Survey_Method_3,3899,6870,We are back on a new topic called Survey Method. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_4,6870,9550,"If you remember, I am Dr. Ritu Sharma. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_5,9550,11860,We have discussed many topics before. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_6,11860,15219,"And today, I am going to discuss a new topic called Survey Method. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_7,15219,21800,Survey Method is a very simple and common technique of data collection or research methodology. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_8,21800,29369,So the learning objective in this module would be to understand this concept of Survey Methods 
Module_26_Survey_Method_9,29369,34610,"and then to see how many types of Survey Methods are there, what is the history behind it and "
Module_26_Survey_Method_10,34610,38060,what kind of steps have been taken in conducting a survey. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_11,38060,42940,Then there are various data collection techniques as well which are part of survey. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_12,42940,48420,"And finally, we are going to understand the advantages and disadvantages of this survey method. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_13,48420,51770,So let us start with the concept of Survey Method. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_14,51770,57570,"There are a lot of ways of conducting a research and collecting information, but one of the "
Module_26_Survey_Method_15,57570,60260,best ways I can tell you is the Survey Method. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_16,60260,67480,A survey is defined as a brief interview or discussion with individuals about a specific topic. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_17,67480,72080,"The term survey is unfortunately a little vague, so we need to define it better. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_18,72080,75750,The term survey is often used to mean ‘collect information’. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_19,75750,83580,"For instance, you might imagine a researcher or television scientist saying that we need to do a survey. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_20,83580,88700,"So, besides a definition above, survey also means to collect information. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_21,88700,94760,We have our first definition of a brief interview and we have a second definition of collecting data. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_22,94760,100490,The survey method is the technique of gathering data by asking questions to people who are 
Module_26_Survey_Method_23,100490,102350,thought to have desired information. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_24,102350,105500,A formal list of questionnaire is prepared. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_25,105500,109710,"Generally, a non-disguised approach is used. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_26,109710,114370,The respondents are asked questions on their demographic interest opinion. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_27,114370,118520,There is a difference between survey and a survey research. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_28,118520,123860,Survey research is popularly identified by opinion polls and market research. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_29,123860,129280,"Whereas surveys, on the other hand, are also a defining feature of sociological research "
Module_26_Survey_Method_30,129280,132120,and they form a part of anthropological inquiry too. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_31,132120,140200,A numerical survey of some kind at some stage of social science research is quite a usual practice. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_32,140200,145590,"Often, the researchers map the physical universe before interpreting the universe. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_33,145590,152310,They establish the typicality of what has been reported or observed and judge the authenticity 
Module_26_Survey_Method_34,152310,155610,of correlation made during the course of research. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_35,155610,161450,The reason for favoring the survey method and other quantitative technique is that survey 
Module_26_Survey_Method_36,161450,169010,provides researcher a way to manage obtaining the data from large and complex societies. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_37,169010,174950,"Those studying social issues pertaining to urban areas, for example, the subject of migration "
Module_26_Survey_Method_38,174950,183310,of rural population to industrial cities would carry out large scale social surveys of migration patterns. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_39,183310,189230,They would use questionnaire as a research tool and process their data on computers. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_40,189230,193270,The usefulness of survey is judged in the context of their purpose. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_41,193270,200930,"Generally, surveys serve the purpose of counting and classifying sets of events, opinions or other forms. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_42,200930,206709,Quantification is involved in surveys which lends more reliability and accuracy to a large 
Module_26_Survey_Method_43,206709,208500,quantity of information. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_44,208500,214400,You can measure the usefulness of a survey in terms of objectiveness of your research. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_45,214400,220129,We need to remember that you cannot gather all types of information by one method alone. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_46,220129,226250,"Further, different methods, for example, direct face-to-face questioning, inferring by observation "
Module_26_Survey_Method_47,226250,233700,and counting heads through surveys offer different outcomes and quite often complement each other 
Module_26_Survey_Method_48,233700,238269,to provide a more integrated set of data for interpretation and analysis. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_49,238269,244739,Mitchell observed that quantitative methods are subordinate to qualitative research and 
Module_26_Survey_Method_50,244739,251209,obtaining quantified data is only a means to reaching the understanding that is not 
Module_26_Survey_Method_51,251209,253730,possible for statistics to capture. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_52,253730,259079,All the same there has been a growing engagement in quantitative method. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_53,259079,266290,"As pointed out by Ellen, we need to make a distinction between what one is able to survey "
Module_26_Survey_Method_54,266290,271819,and collect as facts and survey of facts as reported by respondents. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_55,271819,277800,The first is a simple counting of items and the second is a counting of statement about items. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_56,277800,284199,"As opinions of respondents also are social fact, it is important to take note of them. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_57,284199,291139,Placing such data the data the social context that taking the account of other kinds of 
Module_26_Survey_Method_58,291139,298479,"data, one can expect to achieve the objectives of obtaining scientifically reliable and accurate "
Module_26_Survey_Method_59,298479,302240,information for further interpretation and analysis. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_60,302240,309069,"By other kinds of data, we mean “hard facts” provided, for example, by census material "
Module_26_Survey_Method_61,309069,310580,and government surveys. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_62,310580,315879,"In all surveys, we need to look carefully at the way of information gathering as well "
Module_26_Survey_Method_63,315879,319080,as the way of its interpretation. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_64,319080,324490,Most useful surveys employ the strategy of first knowing the field from the close quarters 
Module_26_Survey_Method_65,324490,329830,through intensive fieldwork that offers the opportunity of close contact with people. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_66,329830,335069,Only then it becomes possible to frame relevant questions to go in the questionnaire. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_67,335069,340400,"For getting the respondents to cooperate in filling the questionnaire, it is important "
Module_26_Survey_Method_68,340400,346039,to publicize the survey and establish prior contact with the respondent. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_69,346039,352439,"So, social science research techniques are often classified into two categories, namely "
Module_26_Survey_Method_70,352439,353939,quantitative and qualitative. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_71,353939,358120,Qualitative research enables us to understand the subtle aspects of social relations. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_72,358120,364650,"They are particularly useful when one is interested in probing a specific question in depth, its "
Module_26_Survey_Method_73,364650,367009,meaning and the different interpretation. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_74,367009,370430,"However, qualitative method also have their limitation. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_75,370430,376069,"They are, for example, most suitable when research is being carried out in a small setting "
Module_26_Survey_Method_76,376069,380100,or in a focused or a specific group or community. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_77,380100,386490,"Qualitative research methods are not very useful when we need to know about macro phenomena, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_78,386490,394210,"such as the demographic structure of a population or the extent and nature of poverty, disease. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_79,394210,401520,Quantitative method or survey research enables us to study these questions in a more comprehensive manner. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_80,401520,407719,"Depending upon the requirement, survey research can be extended to a large an area of population "
Module_26_Survey_Method_81,407719,411249,as a whole nation or even the entire world. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_82,411249,416440,"Thus, when the universe of study is large and the researchers are looking for broad "
Module_26_Survey_Method_83,416440,421969,"trends or patterns in a given population, they often resort to survey methods. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_84,421969,427909,"In other words, qualitative and quantitative research methods are not oppo… opposite to each other.  "
Module_26_Survey_Method_85,427909,429530,They are complementary. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_86,429530,432960,The two can be combined one enriching the other. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_87,432960,439319,Data collection through surveys involves persuasion of respondents and then on some level social 
Module_26_Survey_Method_88,439319,442550,interaction between the respondents and the research interviews. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_89,442550,447940,A team of efforts or many people having diverse skills is required. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_90,447940,451110,Surveys are now used in all areas of life. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_91,451110,456159,"For example, business, politics, agriculture, industry, education, and media. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_92,456159,460809,"So, when did actually this survey came as a technique? "
Module_26_Survey_Method_93,460809,464660,Let us go back to the history of the survey method. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_94,464660,470219,"Though systematically carried out surveys have a short history, rulers in the past have "
Module_26_Survey_Method_95,470219,476529,always been interested in finding out what was going on in their states and the conditions of their subjects. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_96,476529,481940,"There are umpteen stories of rulers or their representatives going to meet the public, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_97,481940,490080,"sometimes incognito, within the explicit intent of enquiring about their welfare and any seeds of discontent. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_98,490080,494060,This was considered extremely important for proper rule. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_99,494060,498360,"In ancient times, roman empire polled surveys of the citizens. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_100,498360,505319,The Victorian social reforms understood surveys and interviewed ten to twenty thousand persons 
Module_26_Survey_Method_101,505319,509740,for seeking an adequate representation of opinion. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_102,509740,515770,"These early social researchers quantified the income, hours and conditioning of work, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_103,515770,521460,"housing, standard of living, size of family and dwelling, frequency of sickness, leisure "
Module_26_Survey_Method_104,521460,525170,activities and club and union membership of Britain's poor. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_105,525170,529930,"However, survey research in its systematic form began after the Industrial Revolution "
Module_26_Survey_Method_106,529930,532170,and urbanization of Europe. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_107,532170,538160,Karl Marx was perhaps the first social scientist to collect information from some key informants 
Module_26_Survey_Method_108,538160,542880,about the condition of industrial workers and tried to relate it to the theory of class 
Module_26_Survey_Method_109,542880,545330,society and class struggle. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_110,545330,550830,"On the basis of such data, he also tried to quantify worker’s exploitation in terms "
Module_26_Survey_Method_111,550830,554110,of working hours and wages. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_112,554110,557880,An important development in the evolution of sample survey method was the introduction 
Module_26_Survey_Method_113,557880,559730,of public opinion polls. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_114,559730,566210,"The Gallup Organization introduced public opinion polling into Britain in nineteen thirty-seven, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_115,566210,571630,and nineteen forty six saw the formation of the Market Research Society in Britain. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_116,571630,577390,The impetus for social-survey-style research after the Second World War was maintained 
Module_26_Survey_Method_117,577390,583680,by the increased role of government with the advent of the welfare state and by the expansion 
Module_26_Survey_Method_118,583680,587560,of the social sciences in further and higher education. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_119,587560,593080,Sample survey played an important role in academic circle by providing social science 
Module_26_Survey_Method_120,593080,600270,researcher with the means for collecting large scale data about different aspects of social life.  
Module_26_Survey_Method_121,600270,605180,"Now, as we have understood the history of survey method, let us go back and understand "
Module_26_Survey_Method_122,605180,608870,that why there is a need for survey method. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_123,608870,615460,"So, survey method can be used to provide someone with information to describe the situation "
Module_26_Survey_Method_124,615460,622160,"or to explain the situation or to, or in identifying the problems and solving them. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_125,622160,624910,It also helps in measuring the change. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_126,624910,629400,It not only studies the attitude but also the behavior and habits of the people. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_127,629400,631760,It examines the cause and effect relationship. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_128,631760,637500,"It studies the characteristics of a phenomena, formulates a hypothesis, tests a hypothesis "
Module_26_Survey_Method_129,637500,639280,and then helps in decision making. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_130,639280,646730,Sample surveys are conducted in order to provide the researcher or the sponsor of the researcher 
Module_26_Survey_Method_131,646730,653430,"with statistical information, either on a particular issue or problem that needs to be resolved. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_132,653430,658880,This involves me… measuring various phenomena and drawing conclusion about any relationship 
Module_26_Survey_Method_133,658880,662150,between them to establish pattern of cause and effect. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_134,662150,667960,"For instance, in a study of industrial relations, we might compare different workplace in terms "
Module_26_Survey_Method_135,667960,676890,of a number of variables that that we hypothesize are likely to be associated with the industrial dissent.  
Module_26_Survey_Method_136,676890,683000,"This might be the size of the firm or organization, the type of industry, the inclusiveness of "
Module_26_Survey_Method_137,683000,690460,"the decision making or whether the organization is unionized or not, the skill level of the "
Module_26_Survey_Method_138,690460,695660,"employees, the gender mix within the organization, the balance between part-time and full-time "
Module_26_Survey_Method_139,695660,700200,employees and the employ… unemployment rate in the local area and so on. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_140,700200,706120,To analyze such relationship and draw widespread conclusion requires the researcher to generate 
Module_26_Survey_Method_141,706120,713550,large amount of data so that conclusions can be generalized from the sample surveys to 
Module_26_Survey_Method_142,713550,717590,the wider population from which the survey respondents were drawn. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_143,717590,722870,In order to have confidence in the results generated from a sample survey and to eliminate 
Module_26_Survey_Method_144,722870,729480,"or minimise bias, the researcher should aim to maximize the response rate and in doing "
Module_26_Survey_Method_145,729480,735310,so ensure that the study is representative of the population group. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_146,735310,738530,Now let us understand the various types of surveys. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_147,738530,741260,The first one is the Descriptive Survey. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_148,741260,747310,A descriptive survey attempts to picture or document current conditions or attitude that 
Module_26_Survey_Method_149,747310,750110,is to describe what exists at the moment. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_150,750110,756910,Examples are Audience survey to determine the program program taste. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_151,756910,762600,"To study the changes, values, lifestyles and the effect of some special type of program. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_152,762600,764000,"Then, there is Analytical survey. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_153,764000,771110,An analytical survey attempts to describe and explain why certain situation exist. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_154,771110,777740,There we examine two or more variable to test or research hypothesis. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_155,777740,785300,Example could be how lifestyle affects the TV viewing habits imp… or impact of war 
Module_26_Survey_Method_156,785300,786380,games on teenagers. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_157,786380,793420,"Some more type of surveys are factual surveys, that is respondents act as reporters. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_158,793420,798490,"Then, opinion surveys where respondents express his views, point of opinion. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_159,798490,803050,Then there are interpretative surveys where the interpretations are done. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_160,803050,805490,"For example, why do you read newspaper? "
Module_26_Survey_Method_161,805490,809060,"Then, there are steps in the process of survey. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_162,809060,815600,"The very first step is the Research Step and the in research step we develop hypothesis, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_163,815600,821510,"we decide on type of surveys like whether it is going to be mail, interview, telephone, etcetera. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_164,821510,826330,"Write survey questionnaires, decide on response category and design the layout. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_165,826330,830590,"Then, there is the step two, that is plan how to record the data. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_166,830590,833550,"In this, we will pilot test survey instrument. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_167,833550,835660,We will revise the instrument. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_168,835660,840180,And then there will be third step that is deciding on the target population under which 
Module_26_Survey_Method_169,840180,846420,"we will get the sample frame, decide on sampling size and sele… select a sample. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_170,846420,854960,"Then, we enter the data into computer where we will be rechecking all the data, perform statistical analysis. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_171,854960,860640,"Then, we have the step four, where we will locate the respondents, conduct interviews, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_172,860640,862080,carefully record the data. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_173,862080,868450,"And after that, we enter into the, data into the computers, recheck all the datas, perform "
Module_26_Survey_Method_174,868450,871650,statistical analysis of the data. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_175,871650,875130,Step six would be describing methods and findings in research reports. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_176,875130,881100,We will be presenting findings to others for critique and evaluation. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_177,881100,886270,Sample surveys are a method of gathering information by means of personal interviews or questionnaire. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_178,886270,891460,They are sometimes referred to as ‘mass interviews’ because they are a way of collecting 
Module_26_Survey_Method_179,891460,895270,similar information from a large number of people at the same time. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_180,895270,901970,"Sample surveys are based on standardized approaches using standardized instruments, such as questionnaire. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_181,901970,908810,These research instruments employ fixed question-and-answer format so that there is a consistency of data 
Module_26_Survey_Method_182,908810,912570,collection approach regardless of who is actually asking the questions. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_183,912570,920779,"The sample survey is therefore akin to a structured dialogue between usually two people, in which "
Module_26_Survey_Method_184,920779,926270,the researcher ask a series of pre-planned standard questions and the respondent’s 
Module_26_Survey_Method_185,926270,933000,answer are recorded precisely on a form and ultimately turn into a number for statistical analysis. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_186,933000,937210,"In this way, the studies are said to be quantitative. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_187,937210,938620,The uses of survey. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_188,938620,943470,Academic researcher conduct surveys to test out various research hypothesis. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_189,943470,949540,"For example, they may want to explore the relationship between age and political conver… "
Module_26_Survey_Method_190,949540,958310,conservatism or why is it some of the children play truant from schools or under what circumstances 
Module_26_Survey_Method_191,958310,961460,people become addicted to gambling. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_192,961460,965580,"By gathering statistical evidence, survey research may help to support a particular "
Module_26_Survey_Method_193,965580,974930,theory by shedding light on the connections and association that exist between such variables. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_194,974930,980720,"In this way, researchers look for patterns that may explain social phenomena. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_195,980720,984370,Academians are not the only ones who use survey research. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_196,984370,992270,"Other uses of surveys can be broadly categorized as follows- First, government and its agencies, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_197,992270,996940,voluntary sector’s organizations and campaigning groups use survey research to inform and influence 
Module_26_Survey_Method_198,996940,1001450,"the political, economic and social policies making processes. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_199,1001450,1008091,Business of all sizes carry out surveys in their quest for gaining a lead in the market 
Module_26_Survey_Method_200,1008091,1012710,for their products by differentiating their product against those of their competitors. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_201,1012710,1019660,"The media and political parties carry out public opinion polls on voting intentions, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_202,1019660,1023120,partly political leaders and their politics. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_203,1023120,1028759,Survey research can be used to obtain multifaceted data from an individual. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_204,1028759,1035029,"For example, behavior, straightforward questions on what the respondent has done, is doing "
Module_26_Survey_Method_205,1035029,1037189,and may do it in the future. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_206,1037189,1043299,"For example, is it possible to ask people if they use public transport for certain journeys "
Module_26_Survey_Method_207,1043299,1045490,or if they are vegetarian? 
Module_26_Survey_Method_208,1045490,1052820,"Survey research can be used in understanding the belief system, that is what people think will happen. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_209,1052820,1055740,What do they believe is true or false? 
Module_26_Survey_Method_210,1055740,1062919,Do people believe that the National Health Service is safer in the hands of the current 
Module_26_Survey_Method_211,1062919,1065499,government than it was under the previous administration? 
Module_26_Survey_Method_212,1065499,1069970,"Then survey also helps in understanding the attitudes of the people, how people think "
Module_26_Survey_Method_213,1069970,1072120,and feel about certain things. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_214,1072120,1078879,"For example, whether people con… consider that women with pre-school children should "
Module_26_Survey_Method_215,1078879,1081590,participate in their workforce. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_216,1081590,1086309,"And survey also helps in understanding the attributes, these are the personal questions "
Module_26_Survey_Method_217,1086309,1094590,"that concern the characteristics of the respondents, such as her her or his age, sex, ethnicity, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_218,1094590,1096360,religion and employment status. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_219,1096360,1102750,"As such, these questions have the potential to be viewed as sensitive questions. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_220,1102750,1107440,They are often referred to as classification questions. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_221,1107440,1113080,"By employing a combination of such questions in a survey, the skillful researcher opens "
Module_26_Survey_Method_222,1113080,1118970,up the possibility of describing and explaining complexities of social phenomena. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_223,1118970,1122940,A very important part of survey is sampling method. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_224,1122940,1125570,Sampling has been dealt as a separate module. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_225,1125570,1130220,Here we will have a basic idea of sampling in survey. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_226,1130220,1136250,Sampling is a method that identifies a representative number from a given universe population. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_227,1136250,1139840,There are two basic properties of a sample. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_228,1139840,1141399,One is it should be adequate. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_229,1141399,1147340,"The second is it should be representative of the universe, that is the entire population. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_230,1147340,1153830,The most crucial point on a sampling is to make sure that one's personal values do not 
Module_26_Survey_Method_231,1153830,1156090,influence the selection procedure. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_232,1156090,1161460,"In order to keep out the researcher’s bias, various techniques or procedure of seeking "
Module_26_Survey_Method_233,1161460,1164309,a sample have been suggested. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_234,1164309,1169659,Then let us understand the various methods of data collection under the survey method. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_235,1169659,1174159,There are four main types of the data collection method for a social survey. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_236,1174159,1181159,The face-to-face interview where the respondent is questioned in person by an in… interviewer. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_237,1181159,1187010,"The main advantage of this method is that it is usually, it usually results in a ret… "
Module_26_Survey_Method_238,1187010,1189190,relatively high response rate. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_239,1189190,1194789,"However, such interviews commonly incurs high cost due to the number of interviews that "
Module_26_Survey_Method_240,1194789,1200660,"need to be employed, and it is also argued that the personal interaction between the "
Module_26_Survey_Method_241,1200660,1204710,interviewer and the res… respondent can lead to a biased responses. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_242,1204710,1209899,"In a study that considers questions of child discipline and punishment, it may be that "
Module_26_Survey_Method_243,1209899,1216659,"respondent will offer the socially acceptable responses, the answer and the answers that "
Module_26_Survey_Method_244,1216659,1219070,they believe the interviewer wants to hear. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_245,1219070,1225249,Postal questionnaires are widely used because they are relatively cheaper to administer 
Module_26_Survey_Method_246,1225249,1228539,and they enable coverage of a wide geographical area. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_247,1228539,1234080,"Also, given that they avoid direct personal contact, they have the advantage at ensuring "
Module_26_Survey_Method_248,1234080,1236860,a degree of privacy for the respondent. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_249,1236860,1242070,The main disadvantage associated with postal questionnaire is that they that they perform 
Module_26_Survey_Method_250,1242070,1244919,poorly in relation to response rate. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_251,1244919,1248080,Telephonic interviews is the another technique. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_252,1248080,1256210,They have become more common in the past decades as technological advances have allowed researcher 
Module_26_Survey_Method_253,1256210,1257649,to draw sample with greater accuracy. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_254,1257649,1260799,They are also very quickly quick to administer. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_255,1260799,1267299,"However, they are limited to researchers who have access to the relevant technology such "
Module_26_Survey_Method_256,1267299,1270980,as random digital dialing technology to carry them out. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_257,1270980,1276850,Online surveys which are delivered by email or make use of web based form in place of 
Module_26_Survey_Method_258,1276850,1279320,a questionnaire are now widely used. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_259,1279320,1284369,"They share some of the characteristics of the postal surveys, in that they are inexpensive "
Module_26_Survey_Method_260,1284369,1290779,"to administer, but they may have lower response rate than interviewer administrating the surveys. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_261,1290779,1298029,"Access to data, the instant responses is sent and being able to draw sample on a global "
Module_26_Survey_Method_262,1298029,1303580,"scale are also attractive benefits, but the difference between the characteristics at "
Module_26_Survey_Method_263,1303580,1311149,internet users and non-user can result in Internet-based samples which are not representative 
Module_26_Survey_Method_264,1311149,1312830,at the general population. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_265,1312830,1319779,"Once the data have been collected, the researcher have to codify and proc… process the data "
Module_26_Survey_Method_266,1319779,1325440,in a manner that it becomes presentable in the tabular form and charts. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_267,1325440,1330879,It should also become accessible for use of statistical treatment that would tell us about 
Module_26_Survey_Method_268,1330879,1334139,the different qualities of the data. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_269,1334139,1339239,Each of these methods of data collection has its own strengths and weaknesses in relation 
Module_26_Survey_Method_270,1339239,1345769,"to design, cost, and so on, and in crude terms one`s weaknesses are often the other’s strength. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_271,1345769,1350909,"The method that is selected will depend on the type of population you aim to research, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_272,1350909,1356399,the nature of the research question and the resources at your disposal. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_273,1356399,1361259,"The advantages of survey method, as compared to the other methods, direct observation, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_274,1361259,1363860,"experimentation, survey yields a broader range of information. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_275,1363860,1371100,"Surveys are effective to produce information on socio-economic characteristics, attitudes, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_276,1371100,1378220,"opinions, motives etcetera and to gather information for planning, product feature, advertising "
Module_26_Survey_Method_277,1378220,1383860,"media, sales promotion, channels of distributing and other marketing variables. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_278,1383860,1389309,Questioning is usually faster and cheaper than the observation. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_279,1389309,1395740,Question… questions are simple to administer and data is reliable. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_280,1395740,1397809,The variability of result is reduced. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_281,1397809,1404749,"It is relatively simple to analyze, quote and interrelate the data obtained by survey method. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_282,1404749,1410980,"Survey research is useful in describing the characteristics of a large population, demographic "
Module_26_Survey_Method_283,1410980,1414320,structure of a population and its emerging trends and patterns. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_284,1414320,1420999,"Survey research can be administered from remote locations using mails, emails or telephones. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_285,1420999,1427610,"Consequently, very large samples are feasible, making the results statistically significant "
Module_26_Survey_Method_286,1427610,1431419,even when analysis analyzing multiple variables. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_287,1431419,1437509,"In survey research, one can ask many questions about a given topic, which gives considerable "
Module_26_Survey_Method_288,1437509,1439230,flexibility to the analysis. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_289,1439230,1443309,We can choose different ways of administering surveys. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_290,1443309,1448220,From face-to-face interview to telephone and e-mails one can use any mode of collection 
Module_26_Survey_Method_291,1448220,1451950,of data depending on one’s requirement and limitations. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_292,1451950,1457710,"Unlike the qualitative methods, survey method is carried out through standardized questions, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_293,1457710,1464710,which make measures more precise by enforcing uniform definition upon the participants. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_294,1464710,1470679,Standardizations ensure that similar kind of data are collected from groups and then 
Module_26_Survey_Method_295,1470679,1475759,interpreted comparatively implying more objectively and higher reliability. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_296,1475759,1479120,We have discussed the advantages of survey method. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_297,1479120,1482700,Let’s now also look at the disadvantages of this method. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_298,1482700,1488679,The first disadvantage is unwillingness of respondent to provide information. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_299,1488679,1492380,This requires salesmanship on the part of the interviewer. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_300,1492380,1498460,The interviewers may assure that the information will be kept secret or apply the technique 
Module_26_Survey_Method_301,1498460,1500499,of offering some presence. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_302,1500499,1504539,Inability of the respondent to provide information. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_303,1504539,1511119,"This may be due to lack of knowledge, lapse of memory, inability to identify their motives "
Module_26_Survey_Method_304,1511119,1513850,"and provide reason, why? for their actions. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_305,1513850,1517230,Human bias of the respondents are there. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_306,1517230,1519159,"For example, “Ego”. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_307,1519159,1521009,Symantec difficulties are there. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_308,1521009,1526529,It is difficult if not impossible to state a given question in such a way that it will 
Module_26_Survey_Method_309,1526529,1528940,mean exactly same thing to each respondent. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_310,1528940,1535850,"Similarly, two different wordings of the same question will frequently produce quite different results. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_311,1535850,1541730,A preoccupation with standardization result in designing questions in every general term 
Module_26_Survey_Method_312,1541730,1545919,to make them minimally appropriate for all respondent. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_313,1545919,1551029,This could lead to simplification and one may end up missing what may be most appropriate 
Module_26_Survey_Method_314,1551029,1552889,to many respondent. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_315,1552889,1559690,Survey research is inflexible in the sense that it requires a precise study design. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_316,1559690,1566750,"Everything must be worked out in advance, the tools to be used and the method of administering the tools. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_317,1566750,1572539,"In order to make survey method logically sound, it should remain unchanged throughout the "
Module_26_Survey_Method_318,1572539,1574220,period of data collection. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_319,1574220,1581230,"In order to make a survey viable and meaningful, the researcher has to make sure that a large "
Module_26_Survey_Method_320,1581230,1584570,po… proportion of selected respondent agree to respond. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_321,1584570,1588789,"This, however may not always be an easy task to achieve. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_322,1588789,1592899,"In such a situation, carrying out a survey becomes very difficult. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_323,1592899,1598320,"Surveys also demand a great deal of attention and honesty on the part of the respondent, "
Module_26_Survey_Method_324,1598320,1604489,particularly when a questionnaire is being used and the survey is self-administered. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_325,1604489,1610130,Respondents may not always be willing to give such attention to filling the questionnaire. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_326,1610130,1616859,"Sometimes, it may be hard for participant to recall certain information or to take clear "
Module_26_Survey_Method_327,1616859,1619299,"position of, on controversial issues. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_328,1619299,1624409,Another problem with the survey research is that it is invariably context-blind. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_329,1624409,1630159,"However, in the social world, context and the environment in which questions are being "
Module_26_Survey_Method_330,1630159,1633909,asked and answers give given is very important. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_331,1633909,1639850,"For example, the response of a female respondent being asked questions about gender equality "
Module_26_Survey_Method_332,1639850,1645330,"in their home, in the presence of her husband and other family members may be very different "
Module_26_Survey_Method_333,1645330,1650830,from the same question asked at her workplace where she is employed. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_334,1650830,1655729,Survey research can rarely see the question of context. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_335,1655729,1661690,"As we have seen the advantage and disadvantage of survey method, let us also see how we can "
Module_26_Survey_Method_336,1661690,1662950,overcome these limitations. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_337,1662950,1669350,"So, the, to overcome survey limitation, we have to carefully frame and phrase the questions. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_338,1669350,1676299,Careful control of data gathering by employing specially trained investigators who will observe 
Module_26_Survey_Method_339,1676299,1680659,carefully report on subtle reactions of the persons interviewed. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_340,1680659,1686529,Cautious interpretation by a clear recognition of the limitations of the data and understating 
Module_26_Survey_Method_341,1686529,1689590,of what exactly the data represents. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_342,1689590,1696809,"This is especially true for responses to questions like, what price would you be willing to pay for this product? "
Module_26_Survey_Method_343,1696809,1702789,"Looking at the facts in relative rather than absolute terms, for example, a survey by a "
Module_26_Survey_Method_344,1702789,1707980,dentist team showed that the number of families in the middle income group used toothpaste 
Module_26_Survey_Method_345,1707980,1714669,"taken by itself in the absolute sense, the result of the survey are in some doubt. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_346,1714669,1719669,"Even though the individual group readings shall differ, say for example, for upper income "
Module_26_Survey_Method_347,1719669,1722570,group families it could be ninety percent. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_348,1722570,1727669,"Hence, we should look at the facts in relevance rather than in absolute terms. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_349,1727669,1733369,"So, to conclude the survey method, we can say that the survey is a type of research "
Module_26_Survey_Method_350,1733369,1740299,to collect the data and facts and some certain situation or issues from the target population 
Module_26_Survey_Method_351,1740299,1743820,existing in surroundings having relevance to the nature of study. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_352,1743820,1748409,A survey research is the research strategy to study the relationship and characteristics. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_353,1748409,1754549,They are based on the desire to collect information usually by questionnaire about a well-defined 
Module_26_Survey_Method_354,1754549,1758909,issue or situation like a hypothesis from the well-defined population. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_355,1758909,1764759,Surveys are the method of data collection from which information is gathered through 
Module_26_Survey_Method_356,1764759,1766539,oral or written questioning. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_357,1766539,1773740,"No matter which approach is chosen to collect data, it is impossible to get hundred percent response rate. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_358,1773740,1776809,All types of surveys have advantage and disadvantage. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_359,1776809,1781519,"In some of them, the researcher have more control over the situation. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_360,1781519,1789210,"For example, the respondents can be influenced or get clues from interviews to respond in certain ways.  "
Module_26_Survey_Method_361,1789210,1793580,"In other cases, respondents try to act smart and mislead the researcher. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_362,1793580,1798309,"Though survey method suffers some drawbacks, still it is considered to be one of the best "
Module_26_Survey_Method_363,1798309,1800269,method of data collection. 
Module_26_Survey_Method_364,1800269,1803039,"And thus, it is the most popular method of data collection. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_365,1803039,1807279,"So, students, hope this concept is clear to you. "
Module_26_Survey_Method_366,1807279,1814090,"And if you have any doubts or any questions, you can write back to me and have a good study time. "

Module_31_SPSS_9,49300,54040,Statistical tools play special role in research methodology and its processes. 
Module_31_SPSS_10,54040,59780,Data collected during research has no meaning without proper presentation in some understandable 
Module_31_SPSS_11,59780,61880,format and well categorized. 
Module_31_SPSS_12,61880,69350,A number of statistical methods are needed to apply for finding and formulating conclusions and applications. 
Module_31_SPSS_13,69350,77680,Statistics formulation and presentation is art and counting as essential skill for the researcher.   
Module_31_SPSS_14,77680,83920,"Various statistical applications like mean, mode, median, standard deviations, correlation, "
Module_31_SPSS_15,83920,90610,"regression, probability, chi-square, etcetera are used for analyze, synthesize, evaluate "

Module_31_SPSS_17,94650,100460,"Before introduction of computers and statistical package, data processing and analysis was "
Module_31_SPSS_18,100460,106090,mostly involved manual calculation and presentation of data collected. 
Module_31_SPSS_19,106090,110380,Manual methods is commonly used method for processing of data. 
Module_31_SPSS_20,110380,116270,"Under this method data is collected through with various instruments, these these instruments "
Module_31_SPSS_21,116270,124020,"may be data sheet, research cards or register or any bound booklet designed for recording data.  "

Module_31_SPSS_30,165100,167959,the deep observation of the researchers. 
Module_31_SPSS_31,167959,175870,So the researcher can mine… minutely see the calculation by his personal attention in manual data.  
Module_31_SPSS_32,175870,178860,Manual method has more chances of error. 
Module_31_SPSS_33,178860,182330,"On the other side, it also have sev… several demerits. "
Module_31_SPSS_34,182330,186739,Manual methods has more chances of error as compared to computer based processing due 
Module_31_SPSS_35,186739,189349,to involvement of human element. 
Module_31_SPSS_36,189349,195430,"Manual process is also a time consuming, it takes time to collect data and recording of data.  "
Module_31_SPSS_37,195430,204290,Invention and introduction of computers have made revolutionary role in all aspects of human life.

Module_31_SPSS_39,209410,216030,Data processing has become more easy due to introduction of number of software with the help of computers.  
Module_31_SPSS_40,216030,220910,Collected data is entered in computerized data sheet with requisite codes. 
Module_31_SPSS_41,220910,226209,Microsoft XL is commonly used to process data. 
Module_31_SPSS_42,226209,231819,"On the other side, a number of commercial professional software have also been developed "
Module_31_SPSS_43,231819,233410,by software companies. 
Module_31_SPSS_44,233410,238819,Computer based data processing is further classified in two categories – first one 
Module_31_SPSS_45,238819,243959,is offline data processing and another one is online data processing. 
Module_31_SPSS_46,243959,252350,So let's discuss historical aspects of SPSS. The software was released in its first version 
Module_31_SPSS_47,252350,256779,in nineteen sixty eight as the statistical package for the social science. 
Module_31_SPSS_48,256779,266919,"Sir Norman H. Nile, Dale H. Bent and C. Hadlai Hull, invented this software and they established "
Module_31_SPSS_49,266919,272930,one company with the name of SPSS Incorporation. in nineteen seventy five. 
Module_31_SPSS_50,272930,280289,Early ver… version of SPSS statistics were designed for batch processing on main frames 
Module_31_SPSS_51,280289,289039,"computers, including for example IBM and ICL versions, originally using punch card for input. "
Module_31_SPSS_52,289039,298080,A processic… processing run read a command file of SPSS commands and either a raw input 
Module_31_SPSS_53,298080,307099,"file of fixed format data with a single record type, or a ‘get file’ of data saved by "
Module_31_SPSS_54,307099,309169,a previous version. 
Module_31_SPSS_55,309169,317069,"SPSS Statistics version sixteen point zero and later one under Windows, Mac and Linux, "
Module_31_SPSS_56,317069,325439,the graphical user interface is written in Java and the Mac OS version is provided by 
Module_31_SPSS_57,325439,333900,a university binary mak… making it full compatible with both Power PC and Intel-based Mac hardware.  
Module_31_SPSS_58,333900,344120,"Prior to SPSS sixteen point zero different version of SPSS were available for Windows,  "
Module_31_SPSS_59,344120,346610,Mac OS X and Unix. 
Module_31_SPSS_60,346610,354389,The Window version was updated frequently and had more feature than the version for 
Module_31_SPSS_61,354389,355889,the other operating system. 
Module_31_SPSS_62,355889,364469,"SPSS was taken over by IBM Incorporation in January, two thousand nine and in January, "
Module_31_SPSS_63,364469,369599,two thousand ten it becomes ‘ SPSS - An IBM Company.’ 
Module_31_SPSS_64,369599,378119,"Complete transfer of business to IBM was done by October one, two thousand ten. "
Module_31_SPSS_65,378119,386389,So SPSS has a long history since nineteen seventy five when it was established under 
Module_31_SPSS_66,386389,393349,"under a company, till today’s its journey through IBM , it is a very good software because "
Module_31_SPSS_67,393349,395219,it is the oldest software. 
Module_31_SPSS_68,395219,401969,So if you will go through abo… from this through this software you will get a better result.  
Module_31_SPSS_69,401969,409919,"Now we will discuss some other feature of SPSS . Basically, there is an option of split  "
Module_31_SPSS_70,409919,418710,file in SPSS . If you want to make for example a histogram separately for a number of samples 
Module_31_SPSS_71,418710,422689,then it is useful to split the file. 
Module_31_SPSS_72,422689,429029,"If you have two samples, children and juvenile for example and if you want to have a histogram "
Module_31_SPSS_73,429029,440569,"of variables separately then go to data and split file, choose organise output  groups. "
Module_31_SPSS_74,440569,448249,"And choose the variable ‘children’ with respect to group based on, if later on you "
Module_31_SPSS_75,448249,457039,"make a histogram of some variable X, you get a histogram for each variable. "
Module_31_SPSS_76,457039,465520,"Another option is sort data in SPSS . For facilitating, counting, it is sometimes useful "
Module_31_SPSS_77,465520,467679,to sort data first. 
Module_31_SPSS_78,467679,474409,"If you want to count changes from year to year within variable ‘district’, this "
Module_31_SPSS_79,474409,480289,is the example and within each district to sort data by year. 
Module_31_SPSS_80,480289,488110,"For doing this, first go to da… ‘data’ and ‘sort cases’ for filling sort by choose "
Module_31_SPSS_81,488110,493589,the variable ‘district’ and ‘year’. 
Module_31_SPSS_82,493589,499459,Selecting data is another useful functions in SPSS . If you want to analyse only part 
Module_31_SPSS_83,499459,505120,"of the data, then you can go to ‘data’ and choose ‘select cases’. "
Module_31_SPSS_84,505120,514020,"One way of selecting data, you can implement by choosing it, condi…‘condition is satisfied’. "
Module_31_SPSS_85,514020,520900,"Observation is satisfying, for example, for some variables X can be selected instead of, "
Module_31_SPSS_86,520900,526050,we can take ‘and’ or ‘not’ etcetera. 
Module_31_SPSS_87,526050,533150,"For making a histogram in SPSS , go to ‘graph’ and ‘histogram’ and select the variable. "
Module_31_SPSS_88,533150,534640,It is very easy. 
Module_31_SPSS_89,534640,541450,"For making a scatter plot, go to ‘graph’ and ‘scatter’, choose ‘simple’ for "
Module_31_SPSS_90,541450,544840,making a scatter plots. 
Module_31_SPSS_91,544840,550330,"For doing regression, regression is a very essential calculation for a research. "
Module_31_SPSS_92,550330,557280,"So go to, for doing regression, go to ‘analyze’, ‘regression’ and ‘linear’. "
Module_31_SPSS_93,557280,561890,Now you can choose your dependant variable and independent variables. 
Module_31_SPSS_94,561890,569500,"If you filled already the data matrix, you can save ‘residuals’ by means of checking "
Module_31_SPSS_95,569500,574300,‘save’ and choosing for ‘standard’ in the column ‘residual’. 
Module_31_SPSS_96,574300,581840,"For one factor ‘ ANOVA ’, go to ‘analyze’, ‘compare means’ and ‘one way ANOVA ’. For "
Module_31_SPSS_97,581840,588620,"more than one factor ‘ ANOVA ’, you can go to ‘analyze’, you can choose ‘general "
Module_31_SPSS_98,588620,598750,"linear model’ and ‘univariate’, now you can choose your dependent variable and your factors.  "
Module_31_SPSS_99,598750,603560,The the another feature we are going to discuss is transforming data. 
Module_31_SPSS_100,603560,611370,"For transforming a variable or doing quadri… quadratic regression, you have to create new variables.  "
Module_31_SPSS_101,611370,620510,"Go to ‘transform’ and ‘compute’, etcetera,  the new variable will be added to the data matrix.  "
Module_31_SPSS_102,620510,625700,Software for statistical package for social science which is most popular software is 
Module_31_SPSS_103,625700,631260,"used now, now a days by researchers for processing of data offline. "
Module_31_SPSS_104,631260,636760,The package is installed in a computer terminal and data is processed in these computers offline. 
Module_31_SPSS_105,636760,644080,A number of online websites also provide online data processing services on a nominal price to researchers. 
Module_31_SPSS_106,644080,649640,"Free online survey is one of the example which facilitates data collection, processing and "
Module_31_SPSS_107,649640,651870,interpretation in a single platform. 
Module_31_SPSS_108,651870,659480,"Up to a limited extent it provides free services but after ten or fifteen questions, you can "
Module_31_SPSS_109,659480,666680,pay a nominal fees six hundred per month for using this service. 
Module_31_SPSS_110,666680,669780,"It is providing free survey up to limited questions, I already explained you. "
Module_31_SPSS_111,669780,675790,"A number of statistical software have been designed for easy data collection, calculation "
Module_31_SPSS_112,675790,682430,"and processing, assisting research process. "
Module_31_SPSS_113,682430,685220,Some example I am quoting in this module. 
Module_31_SPSS_114,685220,691610,"These are Statistical Analysis System, SPSS that is Statistical Package for Social Science, "
Module_31_SPSS_115,691610,699590,"minilab , Minitab Statistical Software, Stata Statistical Software, R & MATLAB Statistical "
Module_31_SPSS_116,699590,704900,"Software, MS -EXCEL Statistical Software, it is basically the part of the MS Office, "

Module_31_SPSS_118,712430,713720,Statistical Software. 
Module_31_SPSS_119,713720,720680,"Now we will discuss about Statistical Package for the Social Science, SPSS in detail. "
Module_31_SPSS_120,720680,727510,"Basically, SPSS is a window based software program, useful performing data entry of collected "
Module_31_SPSS_121,727510,732840,"data, analysis of the data, collected and entered on the basis of various measuring "
Module_31_SPSS_122,732840,735340,formula and creating tables and graph. 
Module_31_SPSS_123,735340,740590,SPSS is also known for its feature of handling large quantitative data. 
Module_31_SPSS_124,740590,746630,"Nowadays, Apple based applications have also been introduced by IBM who is basically the "
Module_31_SPSS_125,746630,748610,owner of this software. 
Module_31_SPSS_126,748610,755820,It is capable to analyze and fast retrieval of graph and table output ready to make conclusion and decision.  
Module_31_SPSS_127,755820,763730,It is mostly used not only for social science but also in business enterprises for research activities.  
Module_31_SPSS_128,763730,769430,Statistical Packages for Social Science is most popular statistical analysis software nowadays.  
Module_31_SPSS_129,769430,775310,It is used by not only academic community but also by commercial players for marketing 
Module_31_SPSS_130,775310,782610,"research, healthy research, health research, commercial survey, data miners and others. "
Module_31_SPSS_131,782610,789040,"SPSS facilitates several features like statistical analysis, case selection, reshaping of file, "
Module_31_SPSS_132,789040,792760,creating derived data and documentation. 
Module_31_SPSS_133,792760,801070,SPSS contains a number of features like it provide descriptive statistical statistical 
Module_31_SPSS_134,801070,808670,"outputs like cross tabulations, frequency distributive, explore, explore, descriptive "
Module_31_SPSS_135,808670,810780,ration statistics. 
Module_31_SPSS_136,810780,818520,"It also provides bivariateral… bivariate statistics to, for getting means, t-test, "
Module_31_SPSS_137,818520,821820,"ANOVA , correlation, nonparametric tests. "
Module_31_SPSS_138,821820,828340,It supports prediction for numerical outpu… outcomes through a linear regression. 
Module_31_SPSS_139,828340,834670,"It facilitates outcomes too for prediction for identifying groups like factor analysis, "
Module_31_SPSS_140,834670,837180,"cluster analysis, discriminates. "
Module_31_SPSS_141,837180,843210,SPSS statistics can be accessed through ‘pull down’ menu or it can be programmed with 
Module_31_SPSS_142,843210,845620,COM command syntax. 
Module_31_SPSS_143,845620,852850,Now how to use SPSS ? The use SPSS software depends on the way of installing application 
Module_31_SPSS_144,852850,861100,"in a computer system, it may be started with a shortcut icon created during the installation of the software.  "
Module_31_SPSS_145,861100,866480,It may also start through start button under program of the computer system. 
Module_31_SPSS_146,866480,872870,Under the program menu select SPSS for windows by clicking the left mouse button. 
Module_31_SPSS_147,872870,878740,"The primary screen appears after launching of the program shows tutorial, type of, typing "
Module_31_SPSS_148,878740,884180,"of data, ruling, running queries, or opening an existing data source. "
Module_31_SPSS_149,884180,889620,"The window just behind this is called the data editor window, which is primary window "
Module_31_SPSS_150,889620,895341,and used to show the data from file are in use. 
Module_31_SPSS_151,895341,903420,Any one of the options on the start-up dialog box or click of ‘okay’ may be used for starting SPSS . 
Module_31_SPSS_152,903420,909910,Now we will discuss about the file in SPSS. User should be aware about types of file 
Module_31_SPSS_153,909910,913740,used in SPSS software before starting use of it. 
Module_31_SPSS_154,913740,918430,Three types of file formats are used in SPSS software. 
Module_31_SPSS_155,918430,922460,All three files have different nature and purpose. 
Module_31_SPSS_156,922460,928760,First file having extension dot sav is used to data editor window. 
Module_31_SPSS_157,928760,937020,Second file with extension dot spv used for our viewers window and last file bearing extension 
Module_31_SPSS_158,937020,940529,dot sps is the command file. 
Module_31_SPSS_159,940529,947060,These three files are explained for more understanding. 
Module_31_SPSS_160,947060,950820,The first file is the Data Editor Window. 
Module_31_SPSS_161,950820,956779,"Data editor window is used to manipulate data, basically this window is always staying open. "

Module_31_SPSS_165,975600,979240,This file as saved is always required to open the same data work. 
Module_31_SPSS_166,979240,985300,The final is compatible and can be opened with SPSS appli… applications only and cannot 
Module_31_SPSS_167,985300,987480,open with any other program. 
Module_31_SPSS_168,987480,994251,"So students, this file is very important whatever you are recording, you are collecting, you "
Module_31_SPSS_169,994251,999180,"are entering, it will be saved for the future. "
Module_31_SPSS_170,999180,1001490,The second file is the Output view… 
Module_31_SPSS_171,1001490,1006110,"Viewer Window file, basically Output Viewer Window is another window which is used to "
Module_31_SPSS_172,1006110,1010210,carry out various computationals and other tasks. 
Module_31_SPSS_173,1010210,1016420,This window shows results of the data entered in Data Editor Window on the basis of computational 
Module_31_SPSS_174,1016420,1018130,formula selected. 
Module_31_SPSS_175,1018130,1025610,The Output Window Viewer Window shows tables of statistical outputs and graph if any. 
Module_31_SPSS_176,1025610,1029600,It also shows programming language and commands issued. 
Module_31_SPSS_177,1029600,1032970,This window also allows to edit and print results. 
Module_31_SPSS_178,1032970,1040059,"The output of the window is saved with a file, with dot with dot spv extension, as we have, "
Module_31_SPSS_179,1040059,1042009,I have already explained. 
Module_31_SPSS_180,1042009,1048779,The file is also compatible with SPSS software and can only be reopened with SPSS software only. 
Module_31_SPSS_181,1048779,1054129,"At a single time, more than one output viewer window can be opened. "
Module_31_SPSS_182,1054129,1061809,"However, the window which is active shows a tiny blue plus sign. "
Module_31_SPSS_183,1061809,1066299,"The as I have already explained, more than one window can be opened, the output viewer "
Module_31_SPSS_184,1066299,1073090,"window but if you will see which is the active one, so if you will see a blue plus sign will "
Module_31_SPSS_185,1073090,1079039,be appeared at the top of the current file which which you are using currently. 
Module_31_SPSS_186,1079039,1085570,"The third type of file is Syntax Editor Window, which has extension dot sps. "
Module_31_SPSS_187,1085570,1092620,"SPSS is graphical user interface based software, however it also give open to work through "
Module_31_SPSS_188,1092620,1096419,programming language directly through syntax editor. 
Module_31_SPSS_189,1096419,1103460,"Syntax Editor allows basically writing, editing and running commands in SPSS programming language. "
Module_31_SPSS_190,1103460,1110130,"However, while using dialog box or drop down menu Syntax Editor Window automatically shows "
Module_31_SPSS_191,1110130,1112299,commands for the action. 
Module_31_SPSS_192,1112299,1118230,Syntax Editor file is saved with an extension of dot sps. 
Module_31_SPSS_193,1118230,1121830,Now we will discuss about Executive Commands or Dialog Box. 
Module_31_SPSS_194,1121830,1125590,Dialog boxes in SPSS have usually many common features. 
Module_31_SPSS_195,1125590,1132919,The freq… frequency dialog box is used frequently for comparison of variables on the basis of 
Module_31_SPSS_196,1132919,1137869,one base variable for using frequency based results. 
Module_31_SPSS_197,1137869,1145009,"Frequencies dialog box is used through selecting menu ‘analyze’, ‘descriptive statistics’ "
Module_31_SPSS_198,1145009,1147440,and then frequency you have to choose. 
Module_31_SPSS_199,1147440,1156029,"This book, this box is used for getting inference, comparison or other requisite results for "
Module_31_SPSS_200,1156029,1160370,each variable or comparing two or more variables. 
Module_31_SPSS_201,1160370,1166200,"In this dialog box, there shall be a list of all variables selected and for which data "
Module_31_SPSS_202,1166200,1167850,have been entered. 
Module_31_SPSS_203,1167850,1175190,Required variables from left hand side is selected and transferred to right hand side box.  
Module_31_SPSS_204,1175190,1181679,This selected variables are used for showing output statistical… statistics in the form 
Module_31_SPSS_205,1181679,1185419,of statistics chart and other format available. 
Module_31_SPSS_206,1185419,1190749,The selected list of variables may be changed or may include or exclude variables for changing 
Module_31_SPSS_207,1190749,1194440,preferences according to need. 
Module_31_SPSS_208,1194440,1200440,Now we will discuss about various menus and icons in SPSS . SPSS has a number of menus 
Module_31_SPSS_209,1200440,1205049,and icons used during data input and output process. 
Module_31_SPSS_210,1205049,1213629,"It has it has file, edit, check or option view, data transform, analyze, graph, utility, "
Module_31_SPSS_211,1213629,1217090,add-ons and windows and windows data edit… editor. 
Module_31_SPSS_212,1217090,1219179,We will discuss these menu one by one. 
Module_31_SPSS_213,1219179,1227059,"File menu, basically it includes general which are typically used in other program such as "
Module_31_SPSS_214,1227059,1228509,"open, save, exit. "
Module_31_SPSS_215,1228509,1234850,Notice that can open or created multiple types of new files. 
Module_31_SPSS_216,1234850,1241989,"Edit menu includes the typical cut, copy and paste command and allows specifically various "
Module_31_SPSS_217,1241989,1245529,options for displaying data and output. 
Module_31_SPSS_218,1245529,1251570,"‘Click on’ option is the another menu, it is used to see the dialog box to the left. "
Module_31_SPSS_219,1251570,1255559,"This command is used to format the data, output, charts, etcetera. "
Module_31_SPSS_220,1255559,1262470,These choices are rather overwhelming and can be simply taken the default option. 
Module_31_SPSS_221,1262470,1264850,The next menu is the ‘view’ menu. 
Module_31_SPSS_222,1264850,1271590,"Menu allows selecting tool bars to show, select font size and remove the grids… gridlines "
Module_31_SPSS_223,1271590,1274029,that separate each piece of the data. 
Module_31_SPSS_224,1274029,1280890,"And to, it is also useful to select whether or not to display raw data or the data label. "
Module_31_SPSS_225,1280890,1288440,‘Data’ is the another menu which allows selecting many options ranging from displaying 
Module_31_SPSS_226,1288440,1297369,data that is sorted by a specific variable to selecting certain case for subsequent analysis. 
Module_31_SPSS_227,1297369,1302450,"‘Transform’ includes several options to change current variables, for example, it "
Module_31_SPSS_228,1302450,1308999,"helps in changing continuous variables in category variables, change scores into rank "
Module_31_SPSS_229,1308999,1313660,"scores, add a constant to variable, etcetera. "
Module_31_SPSS_230,1313660,1317929,"And the another menu is the ‘analyze’, which includes all the other commands to carry "
Module_31_SPSS_231,1317929,1322590,out statistical analyses and to calculate descriptive statistics. 
Module_31_SPSS_232,1322590,1327239,"Graphs are there, graph menu is there which includes commands to create variable types "
Module_31_SPSS_233,1327239,1332490,"of graphs including box, plots, histogram, line graphs and bar charts. "
Module_31_SPSS_234,1332490,1333852,And the next one is the ‘utility’ menu. 
Module_31_SPSS_235,1333852,1342019,"Utility utility menu allows listing, file information which is a list of all variables, "
Module_31_SPSS_236,1342019,1349640,"their labels, values, locations in the data file and type. "
Module_31_SPSS_237,1349640,1356840,"And a number of other menus are also there like Select Window, Data Editor, Help, that "
Module_31_SPSS_238,1356840,1363799,"helps in many useful options including a link of the SPSS home page, a statistical "
Module_31_SPSS_239,1363799,1365280,coach and a systematic guide. 
Module_31_SPSS_240,1365280,1371929,Now we will discuss about the working of the data editor window which is most useful part of this module. 
Module_31_SPSS_241,1371929,1377519,SPSS facilitates dealing with the complex and qual… quantitative data with the help 
Module_31_SPSS_242,1377519,1379289,of menu driven commands. 
Module_31_SPSS_243,1379289,1384980,"Researchers can convert easily these large quantity of data into charts, tables along "
Module_31_SPSS_244,1384980,1389730,with statistical analysis results with following simple steps. 
Module_31_SPSS_245,1389730,1397240,Data editor window shows the value of data based on variables selected in the questionnaire. 
Module_31_SPSS_246,1397240,1400720,Data editor gives two views – data views and the variable views. 
Module_31_SPSS_247,1400720,1405580,"Initially, variable on the basis of their characteristics are entered in variable views. "
Module_31_SPSS_248,1405580,1411009,"After setting of variable according to the need of the researchers, variable fields are "
Module_31_SPSS_249,1411009,1415730,filled with the data collected in data view format. 
Module_31_SPSS_250,1415730,1421630,Now we will discuss about variable view and data view for better understanding of the table 
Module_31_SPSS_251,1421630,1429509,"Variable view is basically a editor window which, where each and every variable may be defined "
Module_31_SPSS_252,1429509,1431390,on the basis of its property. 
Module_31_SPSS_253,1431390,1434059,It is also called as meta-data of the variables. 
Module_31_SPSS_254,1434059,1437570,Each variable is described in a row. 
Module_31_SPSS_255,1437570,1439399,Property has to be defined in column. 
Module_31_SPSS_256,1439399,1443419,These properties of the variable is called its attribute. 
Module_31_SPSS_257,1443419,1448649,The first attribute of every variable is its ‘name’ which is mentioned in first box. 
Module_31_SPSS_258,1448649,1454239,"It is the main course of heading appeared in data view, in in data entry sheet. "
Module_31_SPSS_259,1454239,1458240,It is always in character which may be extended up to sixty four character long. 
Module_31_SPSS_260,1458240,1459460,The second attribute is ‘type’. 
Module_31_SPSS_261,1459460,1466649,Type is basically explain the types of variables to be entered or recorded. 
Module_31_SPSS_262,1466649,1476200,"Variables may be numeric, comma, dot, scientific notation, date, currency, string and restricted numerics.  "
Module_31_SPSS_263,1476200,1478669,It may be set by clicking the box. 
Module_31_SPSS_264,1478669,1486119,Width of the data view may be set according to size of the data through ‘width’ attribute. 
Module_31_SPSS_265,1486119,1492169,Decimal functions may be activated or assigned to variable if data collected is the decimal 
Module_31_SPSS_266,1492169,1494919,by ‘select decimal’ attribute. 
Module_31_SPSS_267,1494919,1501090,‘Label’ is the next attribute which is actually a short name of the variable if the 
Module_31_SPSS_268,1501090,1502669,description is too long. 
Module_31_SPSS_269,1502669,1506890,The ‘value’ attribute allows to create a list of value label. 
Module_31_SPSS_270,1506890,1509190,‘Missing’ attribute has a unique feature. 
Module_31_SPSS_271,1509190,1516600,"It instruct SPSS to ignore during calculation of statistics like if you are receiving some, "
Module_31_SPSS_272,1516600,1521919,"you have collected some response like do'nt know, cannot say or blank response, these "
Module_31_SPSS_273,1521919,1526080,responses are assigned this attribute for variables. 
Module_31_SPSS_274,1526080,1531690,"‘Column’, ‘align, ‘measurement’ and ‘role’ are some other general features "
Module_31_SPSS_275,1531690,1533179,which may be used accordingly. 
Module_31_SPSS_276,1533179,1538889,"‘Data view’ is another table, rather the another table in the data editor window. "
Module_31_SPSS_277,1538889,1545249,Data view is actually the ground of battle for playing with SPSS . Data collected is 
Module_31_SPSS_278,1545249,1547150,entered directly in this window. 
Module_31_SPSS_279,1547150,1555200,Each row of the ‘data view’ represent observational unit or case or record. 
Module_31_SPSS_280,1555200,1560159,Auto numbering is done by the software at most left column of calculating the number 
Module_31_SPSS_281,1560159,1564140,of sample or target audience who have submitted responses. 
Module_31_SPSS_282,1564140,1571059,The variable assigned in variable view window is appeared as the heading of each column. 
Module_31_SPSS_283,1571059,1577919,Data is appeared as formatted or attributes assigned during assigning variables. 
Module_31_SPSS_284,1577919,1583279,"In the above figure, all figures shows two points decimal numeric variable. "
Module_31_SPSS_285,1583279,1589440,In case of any confliction of data presentation due to attribute assigned to variable is simple 
Module_31_SPSS_286,1589440,1596149,switch over to variable view is possible to change the attribute accordingly. 
Module_31_SPSS_287,1596149,1602200,"After entering of data, the file is saved with dot sav extension file which I already explained earlier.  "
Module_31_SPSS_288,1602200,1608730,"After saving the file, the SPSS saving window is popped up to give message saving the file. "
Module_31_SPSS_289,1608730,1611470,Now we will discuss about analysis of data. 
Module_31_SPSS_290,1611470,1617769,Analysis of data is done by selecting options under ‘analyze’ menu given on the top 
Module_31_SPSS_291,1617769,1620330,of the data editor. 
Module_31_SPSS_292,1620330,1626460,"Under this menu reports, descriptive statistics, tables, compare means, generalized linear "
Module_31_SPSS_293,1626460,1635330,"model, mix model, correlate regression, long log linear, classify, dimension reductions, "

Module_31_SPSS_295,1643210,1649260,"simulation, quality control commands and ROC curve may be calculated or formulated. "
Module_31_SPSS_296,1649260,1657090,Required test or com… computation or for… formula is selected for getting results according 
Module_31_SPSS_297,1657090,1658840,to nature of research. 
Module_31_SPSS_298,1658840,1665320,"The outcome of the file include table, chart and figures may directly be ex… exported "
Module_31_SPSS_299,1665320,1670929,in dot doc or docx format for inclusion in research work. 
Module_31_SPSS_300,1670929,1676389,This feature of SPSS help in saving time of copy-paste of the data table and figure. 
Module_31_SPSS_301,1676389,1684109,"Research has to write, researcher has to write only the text on the basis of result shown "
Module_31_SPSS_302,1684109,1685429,in the output file. 
Module_31_SPSS_303,1685429,1692580,"So, friends, today we learned about a number of statistical analysis software have been "
Module_31_SPSS_304,1692580,1696090,designed for data analysis and interpretation. 
Module_31_SPSS_305,1696090,1707990,"Statistical Analysis soft System, Minitab, Stata, R & MATLAB , MS -Excel,PS, SPSS and "
Module_31_SPSS_306,1707990,1716090,"PSPS, the some example we discussed during this module. "
Module_31_SPSS_307,1716090,1721679,"Statistical Package for Social Science software we discussed, which is one of the best statistical "
Module_31_SPSS_308,1721679,1724489,software maintained and marketed by IBM . 
Module_31_SPSS_309,1724489,1730059,"And the SPSS , as we discussed, it supports extensive calculation for getting a number "
Module_31_SPSS_310,1730059,1732169,of statistical analysis. 
Module_31_SPSS_311,1732169,1738789,"It also helps, menu is there, so with the help of these menu based commands a large "
Module_31_SPSS_312,1738789,1742649,amount of data may be calculated with a span of few minutes. 
Module_31_SPSS_313,1742649,1748399,Data is entered in data view tables on the basis of variable set in variable views in 
Module_31_SPSS_314,1748399,1756240,"SPSS . The output files extracts out not only complex table but charts, graphs and diagrams "
Module_31_SPSS_315,1756240,1758399,as ready reference. 
Module_31_SPSS_316,1758399,1766470,"The use of SPSS as we discussed today helps to save time, reduce error chances and numerous "
Module_31_SPSS_317,1766470,1769999,calculations at a single mouse click. 
Module_31_SPSS_318,1769999,1775899,"So, students, in this module, we learned about computer based method for data analysis and "
Module_31_SPSS_319,1775899,1782690,"outcomes, about various commonly used statistical software, about the use of statistical package "
Module_31_SPSS_320,1782690,1790519,"for social science, about various windows in SPSS , and about commands and dialog box in SPSS . "
Module_31_SPSS_321,1790519,1800299,"And also we discussed about SPSS menus and icons, and the working with SPSS . So I recommend "
Module_31_SPSS_322,1800299,1807820,"you all that as the software is very costly and if it is not available from your organization, "
Module_31_SPSS_323,1807820,1815950,you can download the sample software from the website of IBM . It works for one month 
Module_31_SPSS_324,1815950,1823960,"and this is a trial pack, you can use, you can basically learn how to use SPSS and one "
Module_31_SPSS_325,1823960,1828529,month is a big period for learning this software. 
Module_31_SPSS_326,1828529,1833849,"So, students, my good wishes for your examination and have a good day. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_0,31599,37870,"Dear Students, I am Doctor Ritu Sharma, I’m an Assistant Professor at National Law University,Delhi. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_1,37870,42120,Today we are going to discuss an important module from Research Methodology - Hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_2,42120,46789,While discussing the module we’ll be talking about the meaning and definition of 
Module_7_Hypothesis_3,46789,52870,"hypothesis, the nature of hypothesis, the importance and use of hypothesis in research methodology.  "
Module_7_Hypothesis_4,52870,58339,"We’ll also look into the sources of hypothesis, the relationship between variables and hypothesis, "
Module_7_Hypothesis_5,58339,64149,"the types of hypothesis and ending the presentation with characteristics of a good hypothesis, "
Module_7_Hypothesis_6,64149,67179,hypothesis testing and errors in hypothesis testing. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_7,67179,73340,"So, while we discuss what is hypothesis, we should start with the meaning of it. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_8,73340,77960,Hypothesis is usually considered as an important mechanism in research. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_9,77960,85160,Hypothesis is a tentative assumption made in order to test its logic or empirical consequences. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_10,85160,89940,"If we go by the origin of the word, it is derived from the Greek word Hypotithenai, "
Module_7_Hypothesis_11,89940,94480,"meaning to ‘put under’, or ‘to suppose’. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_12,94480,99299,Etymologically hypothesis is made up two words ‘Hypo’ and ‘Thesis’ which means less 
Module_7_Hypothesis_13,99299,102619,than or less certain than a thesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_14,102619,109829,It is presumptive statement of a proposition or reasonable guess based upon the available 
Module_7_Hypothesis_15,109829,112899,evidence which the researcher seeks to prove through his study. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_16,112899,118130,A hypothesis will give a plausible explanation that will be tested. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_17,118130,123979,"A hypothesis may seem contrary to the real situation, it may prove to be correct or incorrect. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_18,123979,129250,Hypothesis is needed to be clear and precise and capable of being tested. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_19,129250,135170,It is to be limited in scope and consistent with known or established fact and should 
Module_7_Hypothesis_20,135170,138510,be ameable to testing within the stipulated time. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_21,138510,144540,It needs to explain what it claims to explain and should have empirical reference. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_22,144540,150700,Goode and Hatt have defined it as ‘a proposition which can be put to test to determine its 
Module_7_Hypothesis_23,150700,156280,"validity’ and Lundberg says ‘A hypothesis is a tentative generalization, the validity "
Module_7_Hypothesis_24,156280,158430,of which remains to be tested’. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_25,158430,164440,"In most elementary stage, the hypothesis may be any hunch, guess, imaginative idea "
Module_7_Hypothesis_26,164440,168120,which becomes the basis for action or investigation. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_27,168120,175820,"Hence, a hypothesis is a hunch, assumption, suspicion, assertion or an idea about a phenomenon, "
Module_7_Hypothesis_28,175820,180440,"relationship or situation, the reality of or truth of which you do not know. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_29,180440,185480,"So, a researcher calls these assumptions or hunches hypotheses and they become the basis "
Module_7_Hypothesis_30,185480,187230,of an enquiry. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_31,187230,193880,"In most studies, the hypothesis will be based upon your own or someone else observation. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_32,193880,198269,Hypothesis brings clarity and specificity to a research problem. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_33,198269,201630,But it is not essential for all kinds of research. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_34,201630,206390,"So, the formul… the formulation of the hypothesis provide a study with the focus. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_35,206390,211380,It also tells you what specific aspect of a research problem to investigate. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_36,211380,216299,A hypothesis tells you what data to collect and what not to collect thereby providing 
Module_7_Hypothesis_37,216299,218180,"focus to the study.  41 00:03:38,180 -->  00:03:44,890 As it provides a focus, the construction of a hypothesis enhances objectivity in a study. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_38,224890,228440,A hypothesis may enable you to add to the formulation of a theory. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_39,228440,232920,It enables you to specifically conclude what is true or what is false. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_40,232920,239290,"Lundberg observes, quite often a researcher hypothesis is a predictive statement, capable "
Module_7_Hypothesis_41,239290,246320,"of being tested by scientific methods, that relates an independent variable to some dependent variable. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_42,246320,252940,"So, once we know what actually hypothesis mean, we should also understand the nature of hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_43,252940,258060,The hypothesis is a clear statement of what is intended to be investigated. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_44,258060,264680,It should be specified before research is conducted and openly stated in reporting the results. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_45,264680,269060,"This allows to, One, identify the research objectives. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_46,269060,273070,"Second, to identify the key abstract concepts involved in the research. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_47,273070,279250,"Three, to identify its relationship to both the problem statement and the literature review, "
Module_7_Hypothesis_48,279250,284820,and a problem cannot be scientifically solved unless it is reduced to hypothesis form. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_49,284820,290870,It is powerful tool to of advancement of knowledge consistent with existing knowledge and conducive 
Module_7_Hypothesis_50,290870,292590,to further enquiry. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_51,292590,294180,"It can be tested, verifiable or falsifiable. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_52,294180,299000,Hypothesis are not moral or ethical questions. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_53,299000,301889,It is neither too specific nor too general. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_54,301889,303790,It is a prediction of consequences. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_55,303790,307480,It is considered valuable even it proven false. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_56,307480,310930,"Once we have understood the hypothesis, the nature of hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_57,310930,314570,Why is it so important in a research? 
Module_7_Hypothesis_58,314570,318850,"So, toda… now we are going to discuss the importance of hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_59,318850,323380,"So, hypothesis though an important part of research may not be required in all "
Module_7_Hypothesis_60,323380,324940,types of research. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_61,324940,331570,The research which are based on fact finding like historical or descriptive do not need hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_62,331570,337430,"Hillway says that, “When fact finding alone is the aim of the study, a hypothesis is not required.” "
Module_7_Hypothesis_63,337430,342850,"Whenever possible, a hypothesis is recommended for all major studies to explain observed "
Module_7_Hypothesis_64,342850,349889,"facts, conditions or behavior and to serve as a guide in the research process. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_65,349889,353000,Hypothesis facilitates the extension of knowledge in an area. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_66,353000,358950,They provide tentative explanations of facts and phenomena and can be tested and validated. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_67,358950,364780,It sensitize the inv… investigator to certain aspects of the situations which are relevant 
Module_7_Hypothesis_68,364780,368160,from the standpoint of the problem in hand. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_69,368160,372780,Hypothesis provide the researcher with rational statement consisting of elements expressed 
Module_7_Hypothesis_70,372780,380190,in a logical order or relationship which seeks to describe or to explain conditions or events 
Module_7_Hypothesis_71,380190,383639,that have not yet been confirmed by the facts. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_72,383639,390550,The hypothesis enable the researcher to relate logically known facts to inlletual… intelligible 
Module_7_Hypothesis_73,390550,399090,"guess about unknown conditions, it is a guide to the thinking process and the process of discovery. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_74,399090,404330,"Hypothesis provide direction to the research, it defines what is relevant and what is irrelevant, "
Module_7_Hypothesis_75,404330,409230,the hypothesis tells the researcher what he needs to do and find out in his studies. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_76,409230,413700,"Thus, it prevents the review of irrelevant literature and provides a basis for selecting "
Module_7_Hypothesis_77,413700,418330,the sample and the research procedures to be studied in the study. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_78,418330,423370,Hypothesis implies the statistical techniques needed in the analysis of data and the relationship 
Module_7_Hypothesis_79,423370,425850,between the variables to be tested. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_80,425850,432290,It also helps to delimit researchers study in scope so that it does not become broad or unwieldy. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_81,432290,436920,"Hypothesis provides the basis for reporting the conclusion of the study, it serves as "
Module_7_Hypothesis_82,436920,439490,a framework for drawing conclusions. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_83,439490,445560,"In other words, we can say that it provides the outline for setting conclusion in a meaningful way. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_84,445560,451240,"So, hypothesis has very important place in research although it occupies a very small "
Module_7_Hypothesis_85,451240,453710,place in the body of a thesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_86,453710,460680,"So, once we are done the importance of hypothesis, we should also be seeing that how we can actually derived hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_87,460680,464770,A good hypothesis can only be derived from experience and research. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_88,464770,469170,"Though hypothesis should precede the co… collection of data, but some degree of data "
Module_7_Hypothesis_89,469170,475430,"collection, literature review or a pilot study will help in the development and gradual refinement of the hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_90,475430,481660,A researcher should have quality of an alert mind to derive a hypothesis and quality of 
Module_7_Hypothesis_91,481660,485350,critical mind of rejecting faulty hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_92,485350,489640,The following sources can help the researcher in coming up with a good hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_93,489640,491090,"One, review of literature. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_94,491090,496590,Review of literature is very important in forming a hypothesis because you get an idea 
Module_7_Hypothesis_95,496590,503630,of what type of hypothesis you need to achieve your objectives and discussion with the experts 
Module_7_Hypothesis_96,503630,508250,"in the given field to understand the problem, its origin and objective in seeking a solution "
Module_7_Hypothesis_97,508250,512550,will also help you in forming a very good hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_98,512550,516940,Intuitions of the researcher also sometimes help in forming a good hypothesis because 
Module_7_Hypothesis_99,516940,522020,you always have an idea what you are looking for in your research and that actually helps 
Module_7_Hypothesis_100,522020,523810,in forming a good hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_101,523810,529560,Previous empirical studies done on the given area also gi… become a very good source 
Module_7_Hypothesis_102,529560,534940,for hypothesis when you go through the previous researchers that actually gives an idea what 
Module_7_Hypothesis_103,534940,540639,you have to look into when you are conducting your own research. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_104,540639,545009,Once we know the sources of hypothesis and we have formulated the hypothesis we should 
Module_7_Hypothesis_105,545009,549230,also understand what all types of hypothesis are there in research. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_106,549230,555550,"So research problems are too general by themselves to enable us to carry out meaningful analysis, "
Module_7_Hypothesis_107,555550,558980,they need to be specified in a more focused way. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_108,558980,563470,"Hypothesis are specific statement that relate to the problem, the answer to which are likely "
Module_7_Hypothesis_109,563470,570769,"to be yes or no depending upon what is uncovered from the research, like suicide is related "
Module_7_Hypothesis_110,570769,575779,to general level of religiosity or secularization of society. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_111,575779,580699,Another example could be alienation and political participation are negatively related. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_112,580699,586100,"Such statements specify links between different phenomena, in order to explain different pattern "
Module_7_Hypothesis_113,586100,592779,"of behavior that appear to occur, such statement specify links between different phenomena "
Module_7_Hypothesis_114,592779,596920,in order to explain different pattern or behavior that appear to occur. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_115,596920,603620,"However, such pattern or association do not necessarily demonstrate that a causal relationship exist. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_116,603620,608579,We cannot for an instance say ‘socio economic deprivation causes suicide.’ 
Module_7_Hypothesis_117,608579,613100,If that was the case then all those who defined by various yardstick as living in a state 
Module_7_Hypothesis_118,613100,616949,of relative poverty would inevitably commit suicide. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_119,616949,618940,This is very unlikely to happen. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_120,618940,624959,"So, we if we have to understand types of hypothesis, we do need to understand what are the variables "
Module_7_Hypothesis_121,624959,627910,that actually affect these types of hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_122,627910,634170,"So, to understand the type of hypothesis, we need to understand the concept of variable first. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_123,634170,638910,The variables are empirical properties that take two or more values or in other words 
Module_7_Hypothesis_124,638910,642930,a variable is any entity that can take on different values. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_125,642930,650829,"Its, in simple terms, anything that can vary or that is not constant can be considered a variable. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_126,650829,655899,For instance age can be considered a variable because age can take different values for 
Module_7_Hypothesis_127,655899,659709,different people or for the same person at different times. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_128,659709,665800,"Similarly, country can be considered a variable because person’s country can be assigned a value. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_129,665800,671319,A variable is a concept or abstract idea that can be described in measurable term. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_130,671319,677519,"In research this term refers to the measurable characteristics, qualities, traits or attributes "
Module_7_Hypothesis_131,677519,681939,of a particular individual object or situation being studied. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_132,681939,688269,"Variables differ in many respects, most notably in the role that they are given in our research "
Module_7_Hypothesis_133,688269,692120,and in the type of measure that can be applied to them. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_134,692120,697439,The restatement of problem usually provides only general direction for the research study. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_135,697439,701160,It does not include all the specific information. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_136,701160,706639,There is some basic terminology that is extremely important in how we communicate specific information 
Module_7_Hypothesis_137,706639,710420,about research problem and research in general. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_138,710420,714720,"So, weight, height, income all are examples of variables. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_139,714720,719819,In research there is a need to make distinction between various kinds of variables. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_140,719819,723000,There are many classifications given for variables. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_141,723000,728660,We’ll try to understand only the dependent variables and independent variables. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_142,728660,733389,"Independent variables - The variables which are manipulated or controlled or changed, "
Module_7_Hypothesis_143,733389,735790,these are also known as manipulated variables. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_144,735790,742079,Researchers often mistake independent variable and assume that it is independent of any manipulation. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_145,742079,747910,It is called independent because variable is isolated from any other factor. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_146,747910,752420,In research we try to determine whether there is a cause and effect relationship. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_147,752420,756579,"In fact, when you are looking for some kind of relationship between variables you are "
Module_7_Hypothesis_148,756579,761519,trying to say if the independent variable causes some kind of change in the other variable 
Module_7_Hypothesis_149,761519,764119,or dependent variable. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_150,764119,767319,And now we are going to discuss what is dependent variable. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_151,767319,772990,Dependent variables are the outcome variables and are the variables for which we calculate statistics. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_152,772990,777730,The variables which change on account of independent variable is known as dependent variables. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_153,777730,780160,It is something that depends on the other factors. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_154,780160,785499,"For example, a test score could be dependent variable because it could change depending "
Module_7_Hypothesis_155,785499,790079,"on the several factor such as how much you studied, how much sleep you got the night "
Module_7_Hypothesis_156,790079,794589,before you took the test or even how hungry your were when you took it. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_157,794589,798399,Usually when you are looking for relationship between the two things you are trying to find 
Module_7_Hypothesis_158,798399,802670,out what makes the dependent variable change the way it does. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_159,802670,807970,"As we have discussed that a variable is an image, perception or concept that can be measured, "
Module_7_Hypothesis_160,807970,811009,"hence, capable of taking on different values. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_161,811009,817560,The variables that you wish to explain are regarded as dependent variable or criterion variables. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_162,817560,821899,The other variables expected to explain the change in the dependent variable is referred 
Module_7_Hypothesis_163,821899,825480,to as an independent variable or predictor variable. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_164,825480,830699,The dependent variable is the expected outcome of the independent variable and independent 
Module_7_Hypothesis_165,830699,833540,variable produces dependent variable. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_166,833540,837389,So variables can have three types of relationships among themselves. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_167,837389,842869,A positive relationship is one where an increase in one would lead to increase in the other. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_168,842869,846290,"For example, more you study higher your score would be. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_169,846290,852519,A negative relationship is one where an increase in one variable leads to decrease in the other. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_170,852519,856290,"More you watch TV, less marks you are going to get. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_171,856290,861749,A zero relationship is one which shows no significant relationship between the two variables. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_172,861749,866370,"For example, having any kind of food will not fetch you marks. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_173,866370,870209,These are the type of relationship which variables have. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_174,870209,874559,"So, once we have understood variables we can discuss the various type of hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_175,874559,877779,"One, first one is the research hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_176,877779,882529,The research hypothesis could be understood in terms of simple research hypothesis and 
Module_7_Hypothesis_177,882529,884420,complex research hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_178,884420,888709,A simple research hypothesis predicts the relationship between a single independent 
Module_7_Hypothesis_179,888709,893940,variable and a single dependent variable where as a complex hypothesis predicts the relationship 
Module_7_Hypothesis_180,893940,898579,between two or more independent variable and two or more dependent variable. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_181,898579,903949,A research hypothesis must be stated in a testable form for its proper evaluation and 
Module_7_Hypothesis_182,903949,911299,"it should indicate a relationship between variables in clear, concise and understandable language. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_183,911299,915549,Research hypothesis are classified as being directional or non-directional. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_184,915549,920290,A directional hypothesis are usually derived from theory. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_185,920290,925569,They may imply that the researcher is intellectually committed to a particularly outcome. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_186,925569,930730,They specify the expected direction of the relationship between variables that is the 
Module_7_Hypothesis_187,930730,935759,researcher predicts not only the existence of a relation but also its nature. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_188,935759,941389,Non-directional hypothesis on the other hand are used when there is little or no theory 
Module_7_Hypothesis_189,941389,945069,or when findings of previous studies are contradictory. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_190,945069,947299,They may imply impartiality. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_191,947299,951129,Do not stipulate the direction of the relationship. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_192,951129,957439,another types of association are associative hypothesis and causal hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_193,957439,962049,"Associative hypothesis propose relationship between variables, when one variable changes "
Module_7_Hypothesis_194,962049,967749,"the other changes, they do not indicate cause and effect, whereas the causal hypothesis "
Module_7_Hypothesis_195,967749,972009,proposes a cause and effect interaction between two or more variables. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_196,972009,977559,The independent variable is manipulated to cause effect on the dependent variable. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_197,977559,983949,Then there is a statistical hypothesis to test whether the data support or refute the research hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_198,983949,987230,It needs to be translated into a statistical hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_199,987230,990170,It is given in statistical terms. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_200,990170,994569,"In the context of inferential statistics, it is statement about one or more parameters "
Module_7_Hypothesis_201,994569,998089,that are measures of the population understudy. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_202,998089,1000660,"Now, we need to understand what is this inferential statistics? "
Module_7_Hypothesis_203,1000660,1006470,Inferential statistics is used for drawing conclusions about population values. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_204,1006470,1012220,"To use inferential statistics we need to translate the research hypothesis into a testable form, "
Module_7_Hypothesis_205,1012220,1014509,which is called the null hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_206,1014509,1021069,A testable hypothesis contains variables that are measurable or able to be manipulated. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_207,1021069,1026790,They need to predict a relationship that can be supported or not supported based on the 
Module_7_Hypothesis_208,1026790,1028740,data collection and analysis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_209,1028740,1034329,"So, now we come to a very important types of hypothesis which is called as null hypothesis "
Module_7_Hypothesis_210,1034329,1036339,and alternative hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_211,1036339,1041990,Null hypothesis are used when the researcher believes that there is no relationship between 
Module_7_Hypothesis_212,1041990,1047929,two variables or when there is inadequate theoretical or empirical information to state 
Module_7_Hypothesis_213,1047929,1049720,a research hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_214,1049720,1054590,The null hypothesis represents a theory that has been put forward either because it is 
Module_7_Hypothesis_215,1054590,1062169,believed to be true or because it is to be used as a basis for argument but has not been proved. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_216,1062169,1068160,This has serious outcome if incorrect decision is made and null hypothesis are designed 
Module_7_Hypothesis_217,1068160,1070299,by either HO or HN. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_218,1070299,1078890,"A null hypothesis can be simple or complex or associative or causal, which we have already seen. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_219,1078890,1084280,The alternative hypothesis is a statement of what a hypothesis test is setup to establish. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_220,1084280,1088130,It is designated by H one or HA. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_221,1088130,1094279,"It is opposite of null hypothesis, it is only reached if HO is rejected. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_222,1094279,1100539,"Frequently alternative is actual desired conclusion of the researcher, they give special consideration "
Module_7_Hypothesis_223,1100539,1102810,to the null hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_224,1102810,1107570,"This is due to the fact that a null hypothesis relates to the statement being tested, whereas "
Module_7_Hypothesis_225,1107570,1113200,the alternative hypothesis relates to the statement to be accepted if when the null 
Module_7_Hypothesis_226,1113200,1115789,is hypothesis is rejected. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_227,1115789,1120010,The final conclusion – Once the test has been carried out is always given in terms 
Module_7_Hypothesis_228,1120010,1121149,of the null hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_229,1121149,1128159,We either reject null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis or do not reject null hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_230,1128159,1133659,We never conclude reject alternative hypothesis or even accept alternative hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_231,1133659,1139179,"If we conclude do not reject null hypothesis, this does not necessarily mean that the null "
Module_7_Hypothesis_232,1139179,1144559,"hypothesis is true, it is only suggest, it only suggest that there is not sufficient "
Module_7_Hypothesis_233,1144559,1149720,evidence against null hypothesis in favour of alternative hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_234,1149720,1157049,Rejecting the null hypothesis then suggest that alternative hypothesis maybe true. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_235,1157049,1161130,"For example, alternative hypothesis – the males visited cinema more than females and "
Module_7_Hypothesis_236,1161130,1165890,the null hypothesis – the males and females do not differ in respect of the frequency 
Module_7_Hypothesis_237,1165890,1167120,of seeing the cinema. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_238,1167120,1171769,"So, alternative hypothesis is usually the one which one wishes to prove and the null "
Module_7_Hypothesis_239,1171769,1175980,hypothesis is the one with one wishes to disapprove. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_240,1175980,1178950,And now once we are done with the types of hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_241,1178950,1185460,Let's understand how hypothesis is formulated because that is the most important concept in research. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_242,1185460,1191539,There are no precise rules for formulating hypothesis and deducing consequences but there 
Module_7_Hypothesis_243,1191539,1195120,are some difficulties that arise in formulating the hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_244,1195120,1199649,"However, there are certain necessary conditions that are conducive to the formation. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_245,1199649,1205889,"They are for example, richness of background knowledge, in the absence of knowledge concerning "
Module_7_Hypothesis_246,1205889,1211500,"a subject matter, one can make know well founded judgment of relevant hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_247,1211500,1216639,Background knowledge is essential for perceiving relationship among the variables and to determine 
Module_7_Hypothesis_248,1216639,1221210,what finding other researcher have reported on the problem under study. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_249,1221210,1226639,"New knowledge, new discoveries and new inventions should always form continuity with the already "
Module_7_Hypothesis_250,1226639,1232100,existing corpus of knowledge and therefore it becomes all the more essential to be well 
Module_7_Hypothesis_251,1232100,1235720,versed with the already existing knowledge. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_252,1235720,1241620,Hypothesis can be formulated correctly by person who have rich experience and academic 
Module_7_Hypothesis_253,1241620,1245760,background but they can never be formulated by those who have poor background knowledge. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_254,1245760,1252759,"There is another point which is very important in formulating hypothesis, logical and scientific approach.  "
Module_7_Hypothesis_255,1252759,1257909,Formulation of proper hypothesis depends on one's experience and logical insights. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_256,1257909,1261570,Hypothesis does not have a clear cut and definite theoretical background. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_257,1261570,1267440,Partly it is a matter of lifting upon an idea on some problem and it is not always possible 
Module_7_Hypothesis_258,1267440,1274659,to have complete information of an acquaintance with the scientific method for formulating hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_259,1274659,1279110,This lack of scientific knowledge presents difficulty in formulation of hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_260,1279110,1285630,A researcher may begin a study by selecting one of the theories in his own areas of interest 
Module_7_Hypothesis_261,1285630,1290960,and deduce a hypothesis from this theory through logic which is possible only when the researcher 
Module_7_Hypothesis_262,1290960,1296500,has a proper understanding of the scientific method and has a versatile intellect. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_263,1296500,1301010,"At times, conversations and consultations with colleagues and experts from different "
Module_7_Hypothesis_264,1301010,1305740,fields are also helpful in formulating important and useful hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_265,1305740,1310769,And now once we know how to formulate a hypothesis there are few things that need to be kept 
Module_7_Hypothesis_266,1310769,1317289,"in mind in forming a hypothesis, and tha… they are called as the characteristics of good hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_267,1317289,1322410,Hulley says a good hypothesis must be based on a good research question. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_268,1322410,1325960,"It should be simple, specific and stated in advance. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_269,1325960,1332140,"So, a hypothesis could be called as a good hypothesis if it possesses the following characteristics. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_270,1332140,1337149,"One, hypothesis should be simple so that it is easily understood by everyone. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_271,1337149,1341559,"Two, hypothesis should be clear, specific and precise. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_272,1341559,1346710,"If the hypothesis is not clear and precise, the inference drawn on its basis cannot be "
Module_7_Hypothesis_273,1346710,1349149,taken as reliable. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_274,1349149,1352309,Hypothesis should be capable of being tested. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_275,1352309,1356269,Hypothesis should state relationship between variables. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_276,1356269,1360600,Hypothesis should be consistent with most known facts that is it must be consistent 
Module_7_Hypothesis_277,1360600,1363639,with substantial body of essential facts. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_278,1363639,1369139,The hypothesis must explain the facts that gave rise to the need of explanation. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_279,1369139,1375269,It must actually explain what it claims to explain and once if we keep these points in 
Module_7_Hypothesis_280,1375269,1378789,mind we are going to formulate a very good hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_281,1378789,1385509,"So, a very important thing, when we are forming a hypothesis we should also know how to test a hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_282,1385509,1390840,"When the purpose of the research is to test a research hypothesis, it is termed as hypothesis "
Module_7_Hypothesis_283,1390840,1392070,testing research. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_284,1392070,1396039,It can be of experimental design or non-experimental design. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_285,1396039,1401860,Research in which the independent variable is manipulated is termed as experimental hypothesis 
Module_7_Hypothesis_286,1401860,1407019,testing research and a research in which an independent variable is not manipulated is 
Module_7_Hypothesis_287,1407019,1411509,called as non-experimental hypothesis testing research. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_288,1411509,1415700,"As we have discussed then null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis earlier, so while "
Module_7_Hypothesis_289,1415700,1420549,"testing the hypothesis we generally proceed on the basis of null hypothesis, keeping the "
Module_7_Hypothesis_290,1420549,1422350,alternative hypothesis in view. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_291,1422350,1428639,We do so because on the assumption that null hypothesis is true one can assign the probabilities 
Module_7_Hypothesis_292,1428639,1434399,to different possible sample results but this cannot be done if we proceed with the alternative 
Module_7_Hypothesis_293,1434399,1435399,hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_294,1435399,1439200,"Hence, the use of null hypothesis is quite frequent. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_295,1439200,1442850,While testing the hypothesis the following things have to be kept in mind. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_296,1442850,1445279,"First, the level of significance. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_297,1445279,1449130,This is a very important concept in the context of hypothesis testing. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_298,1449130,1454409,It is always some percentage usually five percent which should be chosen with great 
Module_7_Hypothesis_299,1454409,1456429,care and thought and reason. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_300,1456429,1462070,In case we take the significance level at five percent then this implies that null hypothesis 
Module_7_Hypothesis_301,1462070,1468370,will be rejected when the sampling result has a less than zero point zero five probability of occurring. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_302,1468370,1473690,In other words these five percent level of significance means that researcher is willing 
Module_7_Hypothesis_303,1473690,1479889,to take as much as of five percent risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it happens 
Module_7_Hypothesis_304,1479889,1481220,to be true. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_305,1481220,1487110,"Thus, the significance level is the maximum value of the probability of rejecting null "
Module_7_Hypothesis_306,1487110,1494379,hypothesis when it is true and is usually determine in advance before testing the hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_307,1494379,1497470,The criteria for rejecting the null hypothesis may differ. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_308,1497470,1502470,Sometimes the null hypothesis is rejected only when the quantity of the outcome is so 
Module_7_Hypothesis_309,1502470,1508000,large that the probability of its having occurred by mere chance is one times out of hundred. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_310,1508000,1513600,We consider the probability of its having occurred by a chance to be too little and 
Module_7_Hypothesis_311,1513600,1520120,we reject the chance theory of the null hypothesis and take the occurrence to be due to genuine tendency. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_312,1520120,1526100,On the other occasions we may reject the null hypothesis even when the quantity of the reported 
Module_7_Hypothesis_313,1526100,1530409,outcome is likely to occur by chance five times out of hundred. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_314,1530409,1536090,Statistically the former is known as the rejection of null hypothesis at zero point one level 
Module_7_Hypothesis_315,1536090,1539960,and the latter is known as the rejection and zero point five level. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_316,1539960,1545610,It may be pointed out that if the researcher is able to reject the null hypothesis he cannot 
Module_7_Hypothesis_317,1545610,1548500,directly uphold the declarative hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_318,1548500,1553860,"If an outcome is not held to be due to chance, it does not mean that it is due to the very "
Module_7_Hypothesis_319,1553860,1556629,cause-and-effect relationship asserted in the particular declarative statement. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_320,1556629,1564259,It may be due to something else which the researcher may have failed to control. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_321,1564259,1569770,Declaration of a rule or test of hypothesis in other point we need to keep in mind. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_322,1569770,1575200,Given a null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis we make a rule which is known as decisive 
Module_7_Hypothesis_323,1575200,1580659,rule according to which we accept null hypothesis or reject null hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_324,1580659,1588059,"For instance, if we, if null hypothesis that a certain lot is good, then there are very "
Module_7_Hypothesis_325,1588059,1594130,"few defective items in it against alternative hypothesis that the lot is not good, where "
Module_7_Hypothesis_326,1594130,1599419,"there are many, there are too many defective items in it, then we must decide the number "
Module_7_Hypothesis_327,1599419,1604570,of items to be tested and the criteria for accepting or rejecting the hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_328,1604570,1610690,We might test ten times in the lot and plan our decision saying that if there are none 
Module_7_Hypothesis_329,1610690,1616250,"or only one defective items among the ten, we will accept null hypothesis otherwise we "
Module_7_Hypothesis_330,1616250,1621140,will reject null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_331,1621140,1624000,This sort of basis is known as decision rule. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_332,1624000,1629399,"When we are discussing the testing of hypothesis, the important thing that need to be discussed "
Module_7_Hypothesis_333,1629399,1634779,"is the two-tailed and one-tailed test, in the context of hypothesis testing these two "
Module_7_Hypothesis_334,1634779,1639470,terms are quite important and must be clearly understood. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_335,1639470,1645090,A two-tailed test rejects the null hypothesis if say the sample mean is significantly higher 
Module_7_Hypothesis_336,1645090,1648509,or lower than the hypothesized value of the mean of the population. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_337,1648509,1656240,Such a test is appropriate when the null hypothesis is some specific specified value and the alternative 
Module_7_Hypothesis_338,1656240,1660809,hypothesis is a value not equal to the specified value of null hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_339,1660809,1666580,"In a two-tailed test there are two rejection reasons, one on each tail of the curve which "
Module_7_Hypothesis_340,1666580,1673029,can be illustrated as if the significance level is five percent and the two-tailed test 
Module_7_Hypothesis_341,1673029,1679710,"is to be applied, the probability of the rejection area will be zero point zero zero five equally "
Module_7_Hypothesis_342,1679710,1686549,divided on both tails of the curve is zero point zero zero two five and that of the acceptance 
Module_7_Hypothesis_343,1686549,1688860,reason will be zero point nine five. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_344,1688860,1693889,But there are situations when only one-tailed test is considered appropriate. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_345,1693889,1700029,A one-tailed test would be used when we are to test say whether the population mean is 
Module_7_Hypothesis_346,1700029,1704679,either lower than or higher than some hypothesized value. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_347,1704679,1711039,We should always remember that accepting null hypothesis on the basis of sample information 
Module_7_Hypothesis_348,1711039,1716350,"does not constitute the proof that null hypothesis, is true. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_349,1716350,1722269,The only mean that there is no statistical ev… evidence to rejected. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_350,1722269,1728950,And finally we come to the last part of it which is the errors in testing the hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_351,1728950,1733700,There are basically two types of errors we make in the context of testing of hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_352,1733700,1737419,These are called as Type one and Type two error. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_353,1737419,1742490,In Type one error we may reject null hypothesis when null hypothesis is true. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_354,1742490,1748240,"In Type two error when we accept null hypothesis, when the null hypothesis is not true. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_355,1748240,1754009,In other word Type one error means rejection of hypothesis which should have been accepted 
Module_7_Hypothesis_356,1754009,1759740,and Type two error means accepting the hypothesis which should have been rejected. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_357,1759740,1766200,Type one error is denoted by alpha known as alpha error also called the level of significance 
Module_7_Hypothesis_358,1766200,1771269,of test and Type two error is denoted by Beta known as beta error. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_359,1771269,1776919,The probability of Type one error is usually determined in advance and is understood as 
Module_7_Hypothesis_360,1776919,1780360,the level of significance of testing the hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_361,1780360,1785230,If Type one error is fixed at five percent it means that means that there are about five 
Module_7_Hypothesis_362,1785230,1790100,chances in hundred that we will reject null hypothesis when null hypothesis is true. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_363,1790100,1795340,We cannot control Type one error just by fixing at a lower level. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_364,1795340,1800519,For instance if we fix it at one percent we will say that the maximum probability of committing 
Module_7_Hypothesis_365,1800519,1807020,Type one error would be zero point zero one but with the fixed sample size when we try 
Module_7_Hypothesis_366,1807020,1812870,"to reduce Type one error, the probability of committing Type two error increases. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_367,1812870,1816799,Both types of error cannot be reduced simultaneously. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_368,1816799,1821990,There is a tradeoff between two types of error which means that the probability of making 
Module_7_Hypothesis_369,1821990,1827999,one type of error can only be reduced if we are willing to increase the probability of 
Module_7_Hypothesis_370,1827999,1830390,making the other type of error. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_371,1830390,1837910,One must set a very high level of Type one error in one’s testing technique of a given hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_372,1837910,1843669,"Hence, in the testing of hypothesis one must make all possible effort to strike an adequate "
Module_7_Hypothesis_373,1843669,1846970,balance between Type one and Type two errors. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_374,1846970,1852940,And this brings to a conclusion of the module and in this module what we have done is we 
Module_7_Hypothesis_375,1852940,1857170,have discussed the definition and types of hypothesis. 
Module_7_Hypothesis_376,1857170,1861559,"We have also seen the testing of hypothesis, the errors that are there in hypothesis. "
Module_7_Hypothesis_377,1861559,1865769,How do we formulate a good hypothesis and what are the characteristics of good hypothesis? 
Module_7_Hypothesis_378,1865769,1868820,"I hope this module will be of a great help to you, thank you.  "

Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_10,106090,111810,"In ordinary term if we try to understand this concept, research design is a planning of "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_11,111810,116509,detailed outline of any research work.

Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_15,140790,146980,By this term design we can easily understand this is the shape of research and this shape 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_16,146980,154780,"of research can be designed in any way, this is the free wish of the researcher. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_17,154780,159770,But it should be objectively satisfied.

Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_29,240879,249370,"But if he is unskilled, inexperienced in that case he cannot follow any ideal procedure "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_30,249370,263520,"which may provide him a satisfactory result, that is why it is necessary that to opt a "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_31,263520,270260,secure way of doing any study. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_32,270260,273170,This is the pattern of work in research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_33,273170,279450,"If the person is already familiar, experienced in doing research in any particular area of "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_34,279450,283280,"study, he can follow that common pattern. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_35,283280,288419,"But if he has no experience, no knowledge, in that case it is better to go with the experience  40 00:04:48,419 -->  00:05:02,759 and potent followed by the previous researchers for researching their problem similar to present one. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_36,302759,309520,This research design contain the procedure and method or in easy word we can say this 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_37,309520,314830,is the blueprint of whole research work before going to start any task. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_38,314830,324900,"In ordinary sense, if you proceed for any pa… task like any picnic, planning for picnic, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_39,324900,331789,"party, travelling, future planning, business planning or academic planning. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_40,331789,341720,Before executing that planning the person draws certain sketch in his mind that how 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_41,341720,351050,"that act shall be proceeded, what steps will be followed, what means will be used and how "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_42,351050,359569,"that matter shall be reached on final stage or what we can say, this is the strategy before "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_43,359569,361160,starting the task. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_44,361160,367759,"Research dis… design can be called as a strategy, strategy which is psychologically "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_45,367759,372770,designed by the person for performing every step of the transaction. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_46,372770,379940,"Similarly, in the research this is a strategy which is designed by the researcher for performing "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_47,379940,390259,every stek… step of research in a certain direction. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_48,390259,400000,"It guides the procedure, if any strategy which has already been designed, determined by the "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_49,400000,403379,person before starting any task. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_50,403379,409490,"In the light of that strategy what person does, he design a blueprint. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_51,409490,416569,"That means he describe that design in a parti… in any substance, in any manner. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_52,416569,421780,This is a blueprint which is usually required for starting any work. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_53,421780,431479,This blueprint containing both the substantive steps and procedural aspect involved therewith. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_54,431479,439389,The substantive principle which is the objective of research is always kept in mind while performing 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_55,439389,447660,their work through its procedure. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_56,447660,455030,This blueprint contain both basic strategy and the procedure and in the light of strategy 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_57,455030,461690,"and procedure or the objectives of proce… or procedure, the person proceeds further "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_58,461690,470909,and it works as a guide to researcher in the field that what shall be his further step 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_59,470909,478030,"and what step is required to be taken by him in any particular, appropriate manner. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_60,478030,485479,"Research pro… design starts from the beginning to last.  67 00:08:05,479 -->  00:08:11,319 It works from the beginning that is the formulation of research problem till the end of the re… research. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_61,491319,496550,There is a question dispute regarding this particular aspect whether the research design 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_62,496550,501819,comes into action after formulation of research problem or before. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_63,501819,509460,"Basically, the research process starts after formulation of research problem but another "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_64,509460,518880,view of the scientists this is the design means where the person apply his mind with the subject. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_65,518880,525600,"And formulation of research problem, we find there is the involvement of the researcher "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_66,525600,531810,"in shaping the research problem, that means for the formulation of research problem, researcher "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_67,531810,537300,"has applied his mind and shaped the research problem, formulated the research problem in "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_68,537300,539170,a certain shape. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_69,539170,544290,"That is why on this precision, it is also said that the formulation of research problem "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_70,544290,550040,is the part of research design. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_71,550040,560560,Formulation of research any research problem itself suggests that what shall be the basic 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_72,560560,569310,substantive next step of the researcher towards finding the research and following the procedure 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_73,569310,570310,within the research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_74,570310,577850,"Basically, research design depends on following things, first is the nature of research problem, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_75,577850,585430,"objectives of research, purposes of research and limitations of research. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_76,585430,592600,"On the basi… on these basis, objectives and purposes of research research can be classified "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_77,592600,597860,"in two category, one is substantive design and procedural design. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_78,597860,604190,"In every research, this research design is formulated in two stages, first is substantive "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_79,604190,608290,part and second is procedural part. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_80,608290,616110,"In designing, the substantive part first comes. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_81,616110,620300,"Substantive research design is the initial level of designing, which ipso facto comes "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_82,620300,627649,"into shape on the basis of nature of problem, objectives of research and purposes thereof, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_83,627649,634430,where researcher has no alternative choice and no interference in the proceedings in 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_84,634430,635800,the light of the objectives. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_85,635800,639440,He has to proceed in the light of the objectives. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_86,639440,652130,"According to the nature of problem, the objective of research may be descriptive, diagnostic, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_87,652130,656170,"remedial, comparative, experimental, etcetera. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_88,656170,665390,That means substantially the researcher has to design the his research process with these 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_89,665390,677449,"objectives to explore, to describe or diagnose or compare any the facts or variables. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_90,677449,689970,"Before research designing researcher should have the experience and skill, knowledge about "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_91,689970,695740,the steps and procedure to be followed in research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_92,695740,704519,And if he has started research he has to be vigilant at every stage of the proceeding. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_93,704519,710459,The process he is following during the research he should make it confirm whether it is in 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_94,710459,715150,conformity with the determined design or not. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_95,715150,726220,And the procedure followed to pursue research is significant for the objectivity of the 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_96,726220,729649,research or not. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_97,729649,738420,"After the substantive shaping of the re… research part, second the procedural choice "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_98,738420,741880,comes with the researcher. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_99,741880,750410,"The researcher has freedom to select the tools, techniques and the procedure followed for "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_100,750410,760720,"data collection, research procedure whether it shall be the doctrinal research or empirical research. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_101,760720,775600,Researcher has scope of managing between the purpose and limitations of research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_102,775600,781899,Certain defined purposes the researcher has on which he has to focus during the research 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_103,781899,794839,"and at the same time he has certain limitations as to the time, fund or human resources. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_104,794839,804420,"For the sake of balancing between these two, the researcher prefer to follow those methods "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_105,804420,814940,"which are appropriate, work worthy and easy to handle and administer in the given situation. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_106,814940,822829,This is the freedom of researcher to design procedure of his research but he should also 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_107,822829,834580,be attentive on this part that his procedure should be designed in the light of the objectives 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_108,834580,839389,and purpose of the research to be studied. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_109,839389,849910,Objectives and purpose of research design-  It provides the basic shape. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_110,849910,858620,By looking into the research design one can easily understand that what research problem 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_111,858620,866130,has and that what is the nature of research problem undertaken by the researcher. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_112,866130,874660,It reflects the nature of research problem and objective thereof. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_113,874660,884370,Research design also works as an instrument of da… for directing the research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_114,884370,893209,It provides the direction that what action should be made by the researcher. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_115,893209,904569,"Research design contain the hypothesis, research methods selected by the researcher, tool and "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_116,904569,912880,"techniques for data collection, nature of data required for his study.  127 00:15:12,880 -->00:15:25,820 All these steps are guided by this research design to the researcher in his process of investigation. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_117,925820,933329,It also avoids the conflicting situation or confusing situation at any stage where the 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_118,933329,939260,researcher is in a fix that what should be his next step. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_119,939260,947560,Ordinarily he should proceed in the direction of the procedure prescribed in the design 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_120,947560,957630,and sometimes if he find any problem or any such situation in that case he can refer the 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_121,957630,961410,objectives of his research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_122,961410,967410,Procedural design provides the alternative choice to the researcher for balancing between 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_123,967410,972910,his objective purpose and limitations of research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_124,972910,980769,There are various steps of research process which starts from the formulation of research 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_125,980769,998730,"problem, review of literature, formulation of hypothesis, selection of area for research, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_126,998730,1009930,"selection of variables to be studied, samples of study, methods of study, tools and technology, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_127,1009930,1019829,procedure of data analysis and the way of interpretation of his research work. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_128,1019829,1035150,On the basis of nature of objectives and the question to be determined through the research 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_129,1035150,1041610,"it can be classified between two categories, one is qualitative and quantitative research "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_130,1041610,1045709,and second one is doctrinal and doctrinal research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_131,1045709,1056550,"Because the legal research area is studied commonly by the doctrinal empirical method, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_132,1056550,1065220,"so as to nature of data is concerned and what nature of data is required for the enquiry, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_133,1065220,1072130,what kind of enquiry is require that is determined by the method that is qualitative and quantitative 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_134,1072130,1078880,research methods. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_135,1078880,1085850,Qualitative and quantitative research methods; these are two forms of design which makes 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_136,1085850,1092650,the classification on the basis of the enquiry to be made by the researcher. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_137,1092650,1102710,"If the objective of the research is to enquire as to the facts, attributes, behavior of any "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_138,1102710,1110070,person in that case he has to go with the qualitative research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_139,1110070,1116950,If he wants to measure the variables in where the data required for the research is in the 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_140,1116950,1124150,numerical form that is the matter of quantitative design. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_141,1124150,1134610,This qualitative research design is ordinarily applied in social science researches including 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_142,1134610,1136030,the legal research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_143,1136030,1144410,Especially for the legal research this is the prominent area of interest for the law 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_144,1144410,1150980,scholars as to study the social behavior and to see the impact of law on their behavior. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_145,1150980,1160799,"Where the objective of research is to inquire the facts which is of the nature of behavior, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_146,1160799,1170640,"attributes or wi… those variables, those facts which can be of narrative nature, that "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_147,1170640,1178750,is the subject matter of qualitative research and this design is operated and followed for 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_148,1178750,1180760,knowing the qualitative data. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_149,1180760,1182320,What it is? 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_150,1182320,1184850,How it exist? 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_151,1184850,1187220,What is the relation? 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_152,1187220,1194710,All such questions can be answered by following this qualitative research method. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_153,1194710,1202419,The word qualitative implies and emphos… emphasize on the qualities of any entities 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_154,1202419,1213190,and on on processes and meaning that are not experimentally examined or measured. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_155,1213190,1221990,Data of qualitative research is distinct from the data of quantitative research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_156,1221990,1227559,"Data of qualitative research is only observable, observed. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_157,1227559,1232870,The behavior of any person can be observed but it cannot be measured. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_158,1232870,1241029,"The personality traits of any person can be observed, non-measurable, where the nature "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_159,1241029,1246620,of data for quantitative research is measurable and variable. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_160,1246620,1259710,"That means its quantity can vary, which can be measured by on certain skills, like frequency, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_161,1259710,1265940,its strength of students in the class. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_162,1265940,1276740,"Qualitative method may be defined as the technique associated with the gathering analysis, interpretation "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_163,1276740,1284460,and presentation of narrative information. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_164,1284460,1296450,The answer of qualitative analysis comes always in the narrative form. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_165,1296450,1305230,"After qualitative research design, the second research that is the quantitative research design. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_166,1305230,1312390,By the term you can easily understand that quantitative research design means the design 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_167,1312390,1322990,"which used to deal with the numbers, statistics and mathematical variables. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_168,1322990,1329190,Quantitative method may be defined as the techniques associated with the gathering analysis 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_169,1329190,1334000,and interpretation and presentation of numerical information. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_170,1334000,1342670,The primary objective of quantitative design is to investigate those facts which are of 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_171,1342670,1352450,the numerical nature which can be verified or which can be measure on certain scales. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_172,1352450,1362310,Though the qualitative characteristics has also made vari… variable and estimable by 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_173,1362310,1367460,the scaling method in the social science techniques. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_174,1367460,1373760,The scaling method is used to convert the qualitative data into the quantitative one 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_175,1373760,1382220,and it is analyzed in the quantitative form and after analysis whatever the numerical 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_176,1382220,1394380,result comes on that basis the interpretation of any behavior or attributes is given. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_177,1394380,1409730,"The areas of study in the quantitative research maybe the statistical analysis, comparison, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_178,1409730,1424440,census and all those investigations where the data required in the numerical form. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_179,1424440,1435770,"After analyzing, discussing about the qualitative and quantitative methods on the basis of their "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_180,1435770,1445950,"distinct approach as to the nature of investigation, the nature of data. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_181,1445950,1455580,The second way of understanding the research design that is on the basis of the nature 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_182,1455580,1461289,of data that is doctrinal and empirical research design. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_183,1461289,1472480,Doctrinal and empirical research designs are commonly used in legal research and doctrinal 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_184,1472480,1484100,research design is frequently and prominently used in legal research. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_185,1484100,1493059,"Distinction between these two kinds of design, one is doctrinal, second one is empirical, "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_186,1493059,1502770,can be understand on the basis of the terms used to denote these design. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_187,1502770,1508620,First is doctrinal research design. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_188,1508620,1520010,Doctrinal research design is a design which is commonly used to study the facts in library 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_189,1520010,1535970,or through participation in all those activities where the information comes from the credible source. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_190,1535970,1543490,"By the term you can easily understand doctrine, doctrine means any principle and principle "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_191,1543490,1549970,"means all those facts, information which are deemed true. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_192,1549970,1557690,"In our day to day life we used to rely on the informations, universal facts, we do not "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_193,1557690,1561429,go into investigation and test those facts. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_194,1561429,1572309,"Merely on the basis of their acceptability they are, they become the principle. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_195,1572309,1580149,On this approach we can understand the data relied only on the basis of truthness that 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_196,1580149,1587429,the data data which comes from any source of information and that source of information 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_197,1587429,1598880,"is credible, in that case there is no need to test or investigate the fact in real, social circumstances. "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_198,1598880,1605549,It provides the convenience to researcher to proceed his research on the basis of information 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_199,1605549,1610390,which is in the form of doctrinal nature.

Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_234,1894760,1910600,and at last I suggest that the researcher should free from external models suggested 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_235,1910600,1918269,"he should take his own decision in the light of the objective of research, purpose of research "
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_236,1918269,1919659,and limitations thereof. 
Module_6_Himanshu_research_design_237,1919659,1921110,Thank you.

Module_30_Data_Processing_7,29130,34469,which is very much essential to know for a researcher or academician. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_8,34469,40500,"Under this topic we will discuss steps to be followed during data processing, learning "
Module_30_Data_Processing_9,40500,47089,"about various methods of classification, various methods of data processing, that is manual "
Module_30_Data_Processing_10,47089,50539,as well as computer based processing. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_11,50539,60239,Data processed may only be used for analyzing and comparing different responses received 
Module_30_Data_Processing_12,60239,61949,"among target audiences.  14 00:01:01,949 -->  00:01:11,070 The data processing involves grouping of data in classes through conde… condensation or summarization. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_13,71070,78220,The process of converting meaningful information is featured as data processing in a research. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_14,78220,86270,"It starts with recording of all data in a single platform with a view to analyze, synthesize, "
Module_30_Data_Processing_15,86270,88990,evaluate and storing of results. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_16,88990,96390,"Basically, research is a rigorous process involved, involving a number of steps initially "
Module_30_Data_Processing_17,96390,104240,"with formulation of problem, statement or hypothesis, hypothetical statement rather. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_18,104240,111590,Research involves field studies or case studies over a formulated problem with the help of questionnaire. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_19,111590,121410,Observation and collected observation and responses from the target audience are collected as a raw data.   
Module_30_Data_Processing_20,121410,127310,Research process is very much based on the correct recording or collecting of data with 
Module_30_Data_Processing_21,127310,130960,the help of questionnaire or interview or personal observation. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_22,130960,137450,"Basically, data collected in its original form have no meaning and cannot be utilized "
Module_30_Data_Processing_23,137450,141470,directly to correlate with the objective of the research. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_24,141470,148840,"Research plan formulated at the beginning of research directly, the path of processing "
Module_30_Data_Processing_25,148840,154770,of data in various scientific and statistical measures for making it meaningful. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_26,154770,160680,"There are various steps in data processing, the role of data processing starts with the "
Module_30_Data_Processing_27,160680,161730,collection of data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_28,161730,168620,The person involved in data processing must have a sound knowledge of rules and principles 
Module_30_Data_Processing_29,168620,173010,of questionnaire preparation for better understanding of raw data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_30,173010,179900,"All questionnaire, observation sheets must be collected and put at a same platform for "
Module_30_Data_Processing_31,179900,181540,collective process. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_32,181540,187150,A number of steps are involved in data processing like editing of raw data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_33,187150,192760,After collecting the all information we have to follow a number of steps like editing of 
Module_30_Data_Processing_34,192760,199480,"raw data, recording of raw or edited data, coding of recorded data, sorting of coded "
Module_30_Data_Processing_35,199480,207700,"data, classification of coded data and transcriptions of data, tabulations and presentation of data, "
Module_30_Data_Processing_36,207700,210480,"classification of data, analysis of data. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_37,210480,216980,"In very first step it's the editing of data collected, the very first action in data processing "
Module_30_Data_Processing_38,216980,218680,is the editing of data collected. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_39,218680,222240,Data is collected through various data collection methods. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_40,222240,227490,"Data collected processing of data collected is to mean, to clean up or simplify data to "

Module_30_Data_Processing_42,233710,240489,The process of cleaning data for making it ready for analysis and comparing through cleaning 
Module_30_Data_Processing_43,240489,243290,process is called editing of data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_44,243290,252080,"Mr. Kumar in his book elucidate editing process, emphasizes over rectifying the following questions "
Module_30_Data_Processing_45,252080,260659,"researchers may forget to consider, like forget to ask question, forget to record response, "
Module_30_Data_Processing_46,260659,271379,"wrongly classify a response, write out only half response or write il... illegibly. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_47,271379,278110,The process of editing flourishes the research process in various ways too. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_48,278110,284120,Researcher during editing compares the responses with object of the study. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_49,284120,289169,Editing is done to support tabulation of data for comparison. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_50,289169,297550,"And edited for, edited, editing process focuses on discarding of incorrect answers in the questionnaire. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_51,297550,304779,Researchers during editing process eliminate doubtful and inconsistent responses for standardization 
Module_30_Data_Processing_52,304779,306379,of research work. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_53,306379,313440,Editing process also involves changes of responses of questions eligible for another question in the questionnaire. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_54,313440,320620,"After editing of raw data, it is recorded in a data data sheet under the next step of the data processing. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_55,320620,324581,"And the next step of the data processing is data, recording of data. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_56,324581,329849,Data stands no meaning without recording in a prescribed form of media. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_57,329849,337789,"In manual method of recording, editing data is stored on slips or paper schedules with "
Module_30_Data_Processing_58,337789,340240,different color of pen or pencil. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_59,340240,347490,Sharma in his book elaborated that the slips used for recording of data in manual recording 
Module_30_Data_Processing_60,347490,354610,are used as input medium for classifying and sorting of data received. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_61,354610,360789,"He again intricate that if data is recorded in electronic media, devices like punch card, "
Module_30_Data_Processing_62,360789,366860,"magnetic tape, floppy diskette or compact discs are used for preserving data. "

Module_30_Data_Processing_64,374169,377529,storing voluminous data in single disc. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_65,377529,383849,Researcher must take utmost care in recording of data for preventing data redundancy. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_66,383849,390879,And the next step of the data processing is the coding of data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_67,390879,397599,Coding of data recorded is a process of converting heterogeneous responses in meaningful categories 
Module_30_Data_Processing_68,397599,403740,compatible for evaluation and analysis of data to correlate with research plans. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_69,403740,411800,Coding refers to such process where number or symbols are assigned to each and every 
Module_30_Data_Processing_70,411800,420059,"response categorized it, categorizing it in limited categories or classes focusing on "
Module_30_Data_Processing_71,420059,422990,easy way of analyzing of data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_72,422990,428300,Kumar C. Raj Kumar in two thousand eight classify coding process in two steps. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_73,428300,434529,He elaborates first step is to particulari… particularize various categories or classes 
Module_30_Data_Processing_74,434529,437919,in which responses are to be classified. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_75,437919,446930,"In second step, allocation of individual responses into different categories for combined evaluation. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_76,446930,453069,"In the very next step of the data processing, sorting of data is the another step. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_77,453069,461120,Sorting of data notes arrangement of data in a required sequence on the basis of designated variables.  
Module_30_Data_Processing_78,461120,467740,Sorting is not a vast process but treated important while emphasizing arrangement of 
Module_30_Data_Processing_79,467740,473169,related and relevant data in a group at a single place. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_80,473169,480589,Sorting of data on the basis of one variable based on research plan is done in this step 
Module_30_Data_Processing_81,480589,482509,of data processing. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_82,482509,484499,The next step is the classification of data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_83,484499,494919,"Researcher is, pri… research is primarily based on survey performed on a large scale of audience. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_84,494919,502789,There are large number of audience need to be reduced in homogeneous group for any meaningful 
Module_30_Data_Processing_85,502789,507009,analysis which require classification of data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_86,507009,511539,"Basically, classification of data is another step of data processing. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_87,511539,519819,"Generally, classification of data is performed in case large, in case of huge volume of data "
Module_30_Data_Processing_88,519819,523750,received through questionnaire or survey sheet. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_89,523750,533899,Under it individual responses are categorized into groups and classed on the basis of certain characteristics. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_90,533899,541240,"If a questionnaire asks the age of the respondent, the age of respondent can be classified with "
Module_30_Data_Processing_91,541240,546310,age group that is like twenty one to thirty for reducing data redundancy. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_92,546310,550360,Class intervals or a group can be used under classification of data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_93,550360,557190,"The step is much stable, suitable in case of huge number of responses. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_94,557190,565610,The importance of this step is to manage large number of responses in a frequently frequency based comparison. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_95,565610,573790,"Basically, classification of data rely on features or on quantitative characteristics "
Module_30_Data_Processing_96,573790,581670,"like gender, age, nationa… nationality, capacity and intelligence etcetera. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_97,581670,586880,The next step after it is the transcription of data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_98,586880,591670,"After editing and coding, transcription of data is to be performed. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_99,591670,598620,Transcription denotes posting of edited and coding data on an intermediary material from 
Module_30_Data_Processing_100,598620,604470,the questionnaire or schedule in a summarized form. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_101,604470,608149,"Transcription, transcriptions are performed by various methods. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_102,608149,616250,"According to Saravanavel, transcription of data is done through list and telly method, "
Module_30_Data_Processing_103,616250,623589,"card sort method, card count method, strip method or punch card method. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_104,623589,626399,Nowadays spread sheets or Microso… 
Module_30_Data_Processing_105,626399,631720,Microsoft Excel is used for transcription of data with the help of computer system. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_106,631720,638550,Transcription of data is required to organize data in a way to initiate tabulation process 
Module_30_Data_Processing_107,638550,643149,on the basis of data stored in meaningful sequence at a single platform. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_108,643149,652870,Transforma… transcription is used to manipulate huge volume of data received through questionnaire or schedule.  
Module_30_Data_Processing_109,652870,659770,Tabulation is the process of presenting data in a tabulation tabular format for summarizing 
Module_30_Data_Processing_110,659770,663490,data for further evaluation and analyzing. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_111,663490,669079,Comparative and evaluative analysis is based on tabulation of data through tables. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_112,669079,675540,Tabulation may be manual for small research data or it may be computer based in case of 
Module_30_Data_Processing_113,675540,678610,large volume of response data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_114,678610,684139,Tables formulate formulated in the tabulation process perform very important role. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_115,684139,690970,"A table there, the number of steps are there in tabulation of data. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_116,690970,693959,Table must have a relevant heading title. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_117,693959,700160,Table must have been designed with adequate number of columns and rows with clear captions 
Module_30_Data_Processing_118,700160,701810,for each column and row. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_119,701810,709910,Table must be formulated on the basis of variables of same nature for comparison with unit of measurements. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_120,709910,719399,Table must indicate calculation for each column and rows with cumulative tools for reconciling data figure. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_121,719399,722550,Tables must be formed on the basis of type of tables. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_122,722550,727019,"Tabulation process may involve a number of tables, which? "
Module_30_Data_Processing_123,727019,735920,"Frequency tables, response tables, unvariate table, bivariated table, statistical table "
Module_30_Data_Processing_124,735920,737170,and time series. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_125,737170,744019,So a researcher must be well equipped with all the tables which we can use in a tabulation of a data.  
Module_30_Data_Processing_126,744019,752209,"There are two type of tabulation, one is the table, one way table or simple table. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_127,752209,758009,In one way or simple table it is known as simp… it is known as simple table or one 
Module_30_Data_Processing_128,758009,763290,way table where data is arranged and tabulated in a simple way. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_129,763290,771610,"In, in this method data is arranged in a simple way like without any frequency the number "
Module_30_Data_Processing_130,771610,776660,"what we are receiving, we just mention it like that. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_131,776660,782000,"In cross tabulation, rather the cross table where more than two or more variables are "
Module_30_Data_Processing_132,782000,787649,involved and required to resp… represent these in a single table for the reason to 
Module_30_Data_Processing_133,787649,792290,find comparative and evaluative requirement cross tables are used. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_134,792290,800529,"Basically, in cross tables when more than two variables are used and compared, we have "
Module_30_Data_Processing_135,800529,802500,to use cross table. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_136,802500,805350,Presentation of data is most important step. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_137,805350,809329,The next step is the presentation of data and the presentation of data is most important 
Module_30_Data_Processing_138,809329,811019,step in data processing. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_139,811019,815810,Data is required to be present in most undesirable format. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_140,815810,822951,Researchers take serious note to target audience while plan to represent data collection for 
Module_30_Data_Processing_141,822951,826120,better understanding and easy to reconcile outcome. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_142,826120,832149,"A number of methods are used in representation of data like descriptive presentation, graphical "
Module_30_Data_Processing_143,832149,836259,"presentation, diagram, pictorial, mapping and tabular presentation. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_144,836259,842980,A number of methods are used in representation of data as I have already mentioned. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_145,842980,849970,So we have to make through all the methods and we should know the how we have to present 
Module_30_Data_Processing_146,849970,853779,our data with the help of all these methods. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_147,853779,857930,Classification is a process of staging data into useful and usable means. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_148,857930,863430,Till presentation the data is in presentable format whi... which still require arranging 
Module_30_Data_Processing_149,863430,866790,it in sensible format. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_150,866790,873360,"Classification converts haphazard, complex and undesirable form of data. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_151,873360,880000,"In general, classification is a process putting data collection, collected in classes or series. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_152,880000,886029,The main objective of classification of data is to present data in scientific manner. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_153,886029,889999,Classification of data is categorized primarily in two categories. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_154,889999,896610,It’s classification on the basis of attribute and the classification on the basis of variables. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_155,896610,903390,"Classification on the basis of attribute also known as qualitative classification, attribute, "
Module_30_Data_Processing_156,903390,908389,"it is basically on certain attributes, based on certain attributes or characteristic. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_157,908389,915170,Data is classified on the basis of attributes may be simple or manifold. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_158,915170,921100,Under simple classification data having similar characteristics are placed in one group and 
Module_30_Data_Processing_159,921100,924360,the data having different characteristics are placed in another group. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_160,924360,930980,"For example, group of visiting a library people may have from different age group, different "
Module_30_Data_Processing_161,930980,937399,"sex, different subject or practicing different professions. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_162,937399,942370,And another type of classification of data is classification on the basis of variables. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_163,942370,945940,Classification is also performed on the basis of variables. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_164,945940,952660,Variables through frequency distribution are used to categorize data on the basis of class 
Module_30_Data_Processing_165,952660,956490,interval or class limit or discrete series. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_166,956490,960740,Classification of data is done on geographical basis too. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_167,960740,968149,"The data classified on the basis of states, region or districts based on geographical "
Module_30_Data_Processing_168,968149,973980,basis is called spatial spatial classification. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_169,973980,978459,And another step in data processing is the analysis of data which is very important and 
Module_30_Data_Processing_170,978459,982779,very useful process basically. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_171,982779,986670,Analysis is the next process under the data processing. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_172,986670,992379,"However, analysis itself is a next step under research methodology, basically it is considered "
Module_30_Data_Processing_173,992379,993879,as a next process. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_174,993879,1000089,Under data process a connective process is included to correlate data processing with 
Module_30_Data_Processing_175,1000089,1001089,data analysis. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_176,1001089,1006819,"Analysis refers to computation of simple, specific or relevant measures for establishing "
Module_30_Data_Processing_177,1006819,1009660,relationship among various data group. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_178,1009660,1017600,"It is include drawing of inter… inference of, or and relationship for the testing of "
Module_30_Data_Processing_179,1017600,1027520,"research problems, testing of hypothesis and drawing conclusions as per research plan formulated. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_180,1027520,1033330,Data processing also contains a number of methods of data processing. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_181,1033330,1036020,Data processing is performed in two ways. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_182,1036020,1042320,"Manual method is used involv… involving involvement of printing questionnaires, data "
Module_30_Data_Processing_183,1042320,1044230,sheets and research cards. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_184,1044230,1048990,Computer based process of data is another form of data processing where data is stored 
Module_30_Data_Processing_185,1048990,1055340,in word processing software in a computer and processed for involving desired results. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_186,1055340,1058790,"Manual method, it is commonly used method for processing of data. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_187,1058790,1063320,Under the process data is collected through various instruments. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_188,1063320,1069290,"These instruments may be data sheets, research card or register or any bound booklet designed "
Module_30_Data_Processing_189,1069290,1070570,for recording data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_190,1070570,1076310,Raw data collected through questionnaire is recorded in these instruments manually. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_191,1076310,1080820,All calculations and logical operations under the methods are performed manually. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_192,1080820,1086230,Nowaday the the method has going to become obsolete due to involvement of computers. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_193,1086230,1094960,"However, the method has a number of merits and demerits as compared to computer data processing process. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_194,1094960,1098420,Research has a personal involvement under manual method. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_195,1098420,1103910,"All processes of research includes mathematical and logical operations, are performed under "
Module_30_Data_Processing_196,1103910,1106170,the deep observation of the researchers. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_197,1106170,1111570,Manual methods has more chance of error as compared to computer based processing due 
Module_30_Data_Processing_198,1111570,1114590,to involvement of human element. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_199,1114590,1120470,Manual process is also a time consuming process. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_200,1120470,1126250,"Under computer based processing of data, data processing has become much easier due to introduction "
Module_30_Data_Processing_201,1126250,1129250,of number of software with the help of computers. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_202,1129250,1135590,Collected data is entered in computerized data sheets with requisite code. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_203,1135590,1141840,Microsoft Excel is commonly used commi… commonly used to process data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_204,1141840,1147630,"On the other side, a number of commercial professional softwares have also been developed "
Module_30_Data_Processing_205,1147630,1149470,by software companies. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_206,1149470,1155440,"Computer based data processing is further classified in two categories, that is offline "
Module_30_Data_Processing_207,1155440,1159970,data processing and online data processing. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_208,1159970,1165160,"Software for Statistical Package for Social Science, you must be awaring about that is "
Module_30_Data_Processing_209,1165160,1171910,"more, most popular software used by researchers for processing of data offline. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_210,1171910,1177680,The package is installed in a computer terminal and data is processed in the computer offline. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_211,1177680,1184520,A number of online websites also provide online data processing services on a nominal 
Module_30_Data_Processing_212,1184520,1185550,price of researchers. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_213,1185550,1194660,"On the other side, in another module you will find something more about Statistical Package "
Module_30_Data_Processing_214,1194660,1198920,"for Social Science, a lecture by me. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_215,1198920,1204630,"In online websites, the free online websites, there are a number of tools, Google is providing "
Module_30_Data_Processing_216,1204630,1205630,a number of tools. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_217,1205630,1213250,"Apart from that there is a website called freeonlinesurvey dot com, it facilitates data "
Module_30_Data_Processing_218,1213250,1217290,"collection, processing and interpretation in a single platform. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_219,1217290,1222150,It provides free survey up to limited questions and after that it charges a very nominal fee 
Module_30_Data_Processing_220,1222150,1224300,according to type of the users. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_221,1224300,1229280,"It's a very good database basically, if you are doing your research you will get each "
Module_30_Data_Processing_222,1229280,1236180,"and every chart, evaluations and each and every thing but  the output you need with "
Module_30_Data_Processing_223,1236180,1237890,the help of this website. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_224,1237890,1241780,There are a number of issues in data processing too. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_225,1241780,1246010,Sharma in his book observes a number of issues in data processing. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_226,1246010,1252800,"He perceives the first problem as “Don’t Know Response”, under this problem during  "
Module_30_Data_Processing_227,1252800,1259070,the process of data it is very challenging to handle the Don’t Know Response from the respondents.   
Module_30_Data_Processing_228,1259070,1266590,"Don’t Know Response if in a large number, the credibility of question enquired in questiona… question marked.  "
Module_30_Data_Processing_229,1266590,1272040,A good questionnaire with a clear and relevant question must be asked from the respondent 
Module_30_Data_Processing_230,1272040,1275070,to avoid Don’t Know Response. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_231,1275070,1282000,"Basically, if we are getting, a researcher is getting more Don’t Know Response, he "
Module_30_Data_Processing_232,1282000,1290410,or she will have to rethink about the questionnaire he or she circulated for collecting the data. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_233,1290410,1298190,"Other issues in use of percenta… percentage method, other issues is there. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_234,1298190,1302970,Responses are enlisted in the multiple of hundreds for standardize the result. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_235,1302970,1312310,"While converting in percentage, a researcher must be more con… conscious to avoid num… numerical error.  "
Module_30_Data_Processing_236,1312310,1320580,Comparisons of percentiles are much easier but may be vague in many case. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_237,1320580,1325290,Apart from that a number of techniques are used in data processing and analysis. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_238,1325290,1330560,"In data processing, a number of techniques for mathematical calculation of, for data "
Module_30_Data_Processing_239,1330560,1332030,collect… collection is used. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_240,1332030,1336380,Data is presented in table for comparison of variables involved. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_241,1336380,1343900,"According to need and requirement, various numerical measures are used for processing the data.  "
Module_30_Data_Processing_242,1343900,1352850,"Most common methods are arithmetic mean, median, mode, percentile, chi square method, correlation, "
Module_30_Data_Processing_243,1352850,1358360,"regression, variance, standard deviations, cross tabulations and many more. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_244,1358360,1367660,Technique used in data processings are descriptively elaborated under the head data analysis. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_245,1367660,1376000,"In my conclusion, the module emphasizes over various processes involved in data process. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_246,1376000,1383140,The first process is editing of data is a very essential process which reduce ambiguity 
Module_30_Data_Processing_247,1383140,1387550,among research through correction of data at primary stage. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_248,1387550,1396170,It gives us overview on guidelines for researchers for editing of data for enhancing the quality 
Module_30_Data_Processing_249,1396170,1401170,of questions for which appropriate responses have not been received. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_250,1401170,1407261,"Other processes like recording of data, coding of data collection, data collected, sorting "
Module_30_Data_Processing_251,1407261,1413480,"of data, classification of data, transcription of data, tabulation, presentation of data, "
Module_30_Data_Processing_252,1413480,1418020,classification and analysis of data and method of data process have also been discussed. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_253,1418020,1424080,"After going through this module, you will get a number of learning outcomes like you "
Module_30_Data_Processing_254,1424080,1431810,"will know and learn about various steps involved in data processing like editing, coding, recording, "
Module_30_Data_Processing_255,1431810,1434590,"tabulating, presenting of data. "
Module_30_Data_Processing_256,1434590,1440790,"And the another learning object you will get, it's the various issues involved in data "
Module_30_Data_Processing_257,1440790,1444960,processing which may affect the quality of research. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_258,1444960,1451750,And another learning objective would be the about various type of tabulation system in data processing. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_259,1451750,1462990,"So students, I hope you will get a good outcome from this module and I wish you best luck "
Module_30_Data_Processing_260,1462990,1464820,for your examinations. 
Module_30_Data_Processing_261,1464820,1466030,Thank you! 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_0,429,1429,Hello everyone. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_1,1429,6879,"Today, we are going to discuss a new chapter of Research Methodology – that is Qualitative Research. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_2,6879,11820,"As you must have heard about the term ‘research’, it is divided into two parts - One is quantitative "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_3,11820,13370,and the other is qualitative research. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_4,13370,18480,Hope you are having a better understanding by learning all other modules of what is quantitative 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_5,18480,19750,and qualitative research. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_6,19750,26570,"So, to make your concepts more clear, today, I’ll focus only on qualitative research in this module. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_7,26570,30380,"So, I am back again with a new module and I am Ritu Sharma. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_8,30380,37340,I will be discussing here about the qualitative research and in this we will try to see the 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_9,37340,41660,"possibilities for using qualitative approaches and methods in research product, projects. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_10,41660,46920,We’ll also try to provide an overview of the logic of qualitative research and its 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_11,46920,51860,origin within an imp… interpretative tradition within the social sciences. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_12,51860,56500,And then we will try to define the qualitative research approach and cro… contrast this 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_13,56500,58820,with the quantitative research approach. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_14,58820,64129,"To review the main methods for conducting qualitative research project in depth, one "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_15,64129,67320,"to one focus group, interview and participant observation. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_16,67320,72960,"Then finally, we’ll highlight the main issues confronting social researchers when using "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_17,72960,75830,qualitative approach and method in research projects. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_18,75830,82049,"Now, the qualitative research style is more often than not associated with an interpretative "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_19,82049,87920,"perspective in social research, in which the logic of research is not so much to test out "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_20,87920,93501,"given theories about what guides human behaviour, but instead to develop an appreciation of "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_21,93501,98090,the underlying motivation that people have for doing what they do. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_22,98090,103120,"Now, to underly… the underlying the quantitative research style, then is the assumption that "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_23,103120,109380,"in order to understand human behaviour, a researcher must first understand the meaning "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_24,109380,115500,"that people have of the world around them, because these meanings tend to govern their actions.  "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_25,115500,121439,The emphasis given by qualitative researcher to their studies is therefore involves an 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_26,121439,127640,"examination of the perspectives of the people or groups that are of interest to them, their "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_27,127640,129829,"ideas, attitude, motives and intentions. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_28,129829,135010,Qualitative research methods such as in depth interviews and participant observation shares 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_29,135010,136799,some of the following characteristics. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_30,136799,141060,"First, research is carried out in real life settings. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_31,141060,146379,"In order to build up the understanding of how people experience the world around them, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_32,146379,152260,"and to identify what informs their behaviour, the researcher attempts to study actions and "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_33,152260,157639,"talk as it naturally occurs, with as little disruption to people’s life as possible. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_34,157639,163389,"The second point is, quantitative methods, such as questionnaires, surveys and experiments "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_35,163389,169439,"are scheduled as leading to creation of relatively artificial research situation, in which it "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_36,169439,173309,is possible to study real views and real behaviour. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_37,173309,178689,The objective is to take detailed description of people’s behaviour and thoughts to illuminate 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_38,178689,180189,their social meanings. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_39,180189,185629,"This implies adopting an insider’s perspective in research, in which there is likely to be "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_40,185629,191299,"a closeness between the researcher and the people to be studied, rather than an impersonal "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_41,191299,192540,and distanced relationship. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_42,192540,199040,"For instance, an organization based study of absenteeism made, entail a researcher spending "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_43,199040,205029,"considerable time at the workplace, observing how work is organized, the relationship between "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_44,205029,208420,actors and developing a non-threating presence. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_45,208420,213829,"From this vantage point, the researcher will aim to develop a rapport with the employee "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_46,213829,218819,"to gain their trust and confidence, in order to encourage them to speak fully and frankly "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_47,218819,222209,about issues that may be associated with the absentees. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_48,222209,229519,The researcher is likely to adopt an approach in which there is no precise initial specification 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_49,229519,231450,of research issue and concepts. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_50,231450,237040,The focus of the research may change during the course of collecting data as ideas develop 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_51,237040,238829,and particular issues become important. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_52,238829,243939,The qualitative approach involves theory construction rather than theory testing. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_53,243939,249809,Theoretical ideas developed from initial data collection and then go on to influence further 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_54,249809,256400,"data collection, there is a cumulative spiral theory developed and data collection is there. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_55,256400,258689,"Now, defining the qualitative research. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_56,258689,261109,What actually we mean by this qualitative research? 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_57,261109,266210,There is some disagreement about how to define a qualitative style of research. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_58,266210,271930,"Perhaps, the easiest way to begin with is what researchers do, and how this distinguishes "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_59,271930,276189,them from researchers using other approaches from this point of view. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_60,276189,278990,Qualitative research has several important features. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_61,278990,285400,"It involves, first, the study of one or small number of cases, often over a lengthy period of time.  "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_62,285400,291210,"Second, in organizational research, for instance, studies frequently focus on a single agency "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_63,291210,295680,or in small numbers of department or employees within the agency. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_64,295680,300550,"In educational research, the focus may be a single school or perhaps a number of classroom, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_65,300550,305150,teachers and or pupils within or particular sch… school. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_66,305150,309919,"In this context, the data collection process is characterized as being intensive. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_67,309919,316331,Very detailed study involves the collection of large quantities of data from a small number 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_68,316331,318800,of information and settings. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_69,318800,324189,Researcher’s sites and participants are typically selected using theoretical sampling 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_70,324189,325880,or snowball sampling. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_71,325880,332199,"With snowball sampling, researchers aim for typicality rather than generalizalibit… "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_72,332199,335910,generalizability through their sampling strategy. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_73,335910,342030,"However, while the principle of representativeness and generalizability, which are generally "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_74,342030,347000,"applied in quantitative research, are not appropriate for the qualitative research. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_75,347000,353379,"Theoretical sampling, in which research participants and research sites are selected based on the "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_76,353379,359099,"relevance of the theoretical focus of the research, does allow a degree of generalisation. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_77,359099,365469,While the quantitative researcher’s concern lies with the obtaining a statistical representative 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_78,365469,371439,"sample, a qualitative researcher employs theoretical sampling is focused on the representativeness "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_79,371439,373639,of the concept in the research. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_80,373639,380770,And of being able to assess the social processes in which he or she is interested in that theoretical 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_81,380770,385319,sampling leads to the selection of respondents where the phenomena in which the researcher 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_82,385319,389030,is interested are most likely to occur. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_83,389030,394550,"Generalization also follows a theoretical logic, with generalizability of a case to "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_84,394550,399150,the theoretical proposal rather than to the population or universe. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_85,399150,405280,"Indeed, Mason has argued that good qualitative research always ends to achieve wider reason… "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_86,405280,412139,resonance rather than be content with the finding that are idiosyncratic or particularly 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_87,412139,415919,to the limited empirical parameters of the study. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_88,415919,421210,"This approaches in stark contrast with the quantitative research studies using questionnaire, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_89,421210,426560,"for instance, these are designed to investigate much larger number of cases, but which collect "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_90,426560,430380,data for more shorter periods of time on each case. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_91,430380,437039,"Hakim says that he has, Hakim has provided an interesting way to distinguish these two approaches. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_92,437039,444220,"One, if survey offers the bird’s eye view, qualitative research offers the worm’s eye view. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_93,444220,450069,"The adoption of a wide initial focus at the outset, rather than testing of a narrowly defined hypotheses. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_94,450069,454539,Qualitative research tend to begin with no more than a rather general interest in some 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_95,454539,457449,type of social phenomena or issue. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_96,457449,463189,It is only during the course of data collection and analysis that researchers narrow down 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_97,463189,467240,their research problem and begin to formulate and test hypotheses. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_98,467240,472960,A commonly used approach is the method of grounded theory developed by Glaser and Strauss 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_99,472960,474999,in nineteen sixty seven. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_100,474999,479689,"Essentially, the researcher begins with a general problem that she or he would like "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_101,479689,485460,"to explore, conduct the field work, examine this by looking for relationships and patterns "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_102,485460,490300,"in the data, and then turns to theory to try to explain any patterns. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_103,490300,492850,"In this way, theory emerges from the data. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_104,492850,498050,The general strategy might be defined as a research-then theory strategy. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_105,498050,503199,"It adopts an alliterative process, in which analysis takes place while the data is being "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_106,503199,507189,"collected, rather than the, after it has been gathered. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_107,507189,510659,A range of types of data is employed not just one. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_108,510659,516800,Results from observation and or from unstructured interviews are usually the main source of 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_109,516800,523539,"data, but use may be, made of public and private documents and even of official statistics "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_110,523539,524660,and questionnaire data. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_111,524660,529940,"For instance, an int… investigation into declining employee morale at a particular "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_112,529940,535690,"workplace may involve the researcher conducting observation, in-depth interview, questionnaire, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_113,535690,540140,analysing internal memoranda and examining minutes of the meeting. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_114,540140,545410,The guiding principle here is that utilising such an apparently eclectic set of methods 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_115,545410,553000,and data places the researcher in a relatively strong position to develop a holistic account of the issue. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_116,553000,558710,"In combination, these methods might enable the researcher to- Monitor the extent of declining "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_117,558710,564120,"workplace morale, identifying the range of possible situation and contextual factor that "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_118,564120,570380,"may play a part in the trend, observe the relationship that exist between employees, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_119,570380,576410,"develop an understanding of how employees experience work, then examine how the organisation "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_120,576410,582260,"has previously approach the issue, and what step it has taken in the past to resolve it, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_121,582260,584920,and the impact of these approaches. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_122,584920,590720,"Such a research strategy contrast with quantitative research work, which tend to rely on only "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_123,590720,592420,a single source of data. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_124,592420,596209,Minimal pre-structuring of the data that is collected. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_125,596209,600990,It is for this reason that the observation and interviews used by qualitative researcher 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_126,600990,604470,are often referred to as ‘unstructured’. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_127,604470,610100,"On the basis of their observations, qualitative researcher usually writes field notes in which "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_128,610100,616440,"they are, try to describe what they have seen and heard in detail, rather than entering "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_129,616440,622320,with the list of categories and ticking those off which when they observe instances. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_130,622320,628279,"Similarly, the question that researcher ask in an interview will usually be open ended. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_131,628279,635310,"They will try to note how down exactly what information say, rather than interpreting "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_132,635310,637910,the responses in terms of the predefined answers. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_133,637910,643329,"In addition, observation and interviews are often audio or even video recorded. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_134,643329,649310,"In summary, categorisation for structuring and analysing the data are developed in the "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_135,649310,652080,"course of data collection and analysis, rather than beforehand. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_136,652080,659160,The reporting of qualitative research data generally in terms of verbal description and 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_137,659160,665680,explanation with quantification and statistical analysis taking a subordinate role at a most. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_138,665680,668510,"Now, how is a qualitative research conducted? "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_139,668510,675500,"Now, qualitative research as a style of inquiry uses a va… wide variety of methods of data collection. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_140,675500,680899,"As we have seen, the two most commonly used qualitative method in social research are "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_141,680899,684019,in-depth interviews and participant observation. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_142,684019,688270,In-depth interviewing – There are essentially two types of qualitative in-depth interviews. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_143,688270,693660,"The first approach involves one-to-one interview, in which individual response are questioned "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_144,693660,697839,"at length about a particular issue, experience or event. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_145,697839,703310,"The second method uses group discussion or focus group, which are designed to allow you "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_146,703310,708510,to see how people interact in discussing topics and how they react to disagreement. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_147,708510,714319,There are two broadly different approaches to the way in which data are quali… qualitative 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_148,714319,715500,interviews may be read. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_149,715500,721220,"The first, which Silverman referred to as a ‘realist’ approach, treats ‘respondents’ "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_150,721220,726430,"answers describing some external reality, example, facts, events or internal experience, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_151,726430,731920,"example, feeling, meanings, as if such data provides factual accounts of people's life. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_152,731920,737649,An alternative ‘narrative’ approach ‘treats interview data as accessing various stories 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_153,737649,743420,"or narratives through which people describe their world, where interviewers and interviewees, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_154,743420,747620,"in concert, generate plausible accounts of the world’. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_155,747620,752769,"What is central to in-depth interviews, regardless of how the emerging data is perceived, is "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_156,752769,759440,that they provide qualitative depth by allowing interviews to talk about the subject in terms 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_157,759440,761670,of their own frames of reference. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_158,761670,767551,"In so doing, the method enables the interviewer to maximize her or his understanding of the "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_159,767551,769320,respondent’s point of view. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_160,769320,775259,Critics of the qualitative approach would argue that the closeness between the interviewer 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_161,775259,781550,and interviewee that occurs in such interviews implies that the method is inevitably a subjective 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_162,781550,784170,one that lacks scientific rigour. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_163,784170,789370,"The informal conversational process, it is argued, provides too much scope of the interviewer "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_164,789370,794560,"to influence the interviewee’s response, in terms of, one, revealing their own views "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_165,794560,799589,"on the matter, second, the question style used, third, the body language displayed, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_166,799589,805320,"fourth, the body the behaviour and conduct throughout the interview, fifth, however, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_167,805320,810750,researcher conducting qualitative based studies can make use of procedure to increase scientific 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_168,810750,814670,rigour and systematically their general approaches. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_169,814670,821160,Issues such as observing over multiple sites and the recording of interviews are dealt in detail. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_170,821160,826470,There are equally well-established methods for rigorously analysing data that are considered. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_171,826470,831480,Many qualitative research would also counter the criticism mentioned above by asserting 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_172,831480,836500,that it is not possible to achieve absolute objectivity in research. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_173,836500,841740,To condemn qualitative in-depth interview in this way is to ignore the reality that 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_174,841740,844350,all research is subjective. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_175,844350,849829,"Indeed, quantitative research design are influenced by the values and assumptions of those who "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_176,849829,855319,"commission and conduct the research in terms of the questions asked and by implication, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_177,855319,862250,"those that are not asked, the target groups and settings of the selected for the study, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_178,862250,866410,"the research methods used, the method of analysis that are used, the emphasis that is given "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_179,866410,873740,to certain aspects of the data in the analysis of finding and by implication and downgrading of the data. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_180,873740,879500,"The interpretation given to the data, the reporting of the research, in terms of focus, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_181,879500,884610,selection and weighting given to the different elements of the findings. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_182,884610,887570,"Now, what is in-depth one to one interviewing? "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_183,887570,893259,"Unlike, structured interview, qualitative in-depth one to one interviews are open-ended "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_184,893259,900769,"using interview schedule or aid memoires, rather than carefully crafted pro-structured questionnaire. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_185,900769,905389,"The intention is therefore, to capture the point of view of the respondent rather than "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_186,905389,907180,the concern of the researcher. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_187,907180,914690,"Such in-depth one to one interviews are designed to explore issues in detail with the interviewee, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_188,914690,920060,"using probes, prompts and flexible questioning style, both in terms of the ways in which "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_189,920060,923360,questions are asked and the order in which they are delivered. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_190,923360,929269,"In many respect, qualitative semi-structured or unstructured interviews are conducted in "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_191,929269,935160,situations where the researcher’s intention is to share control of the data-gathering 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_192,935160,941270,"exercise with the respondent, to allow the respondent to craft her or his own account "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_193,941270,946569,"of matter in the question, rather than to highli… highly structured data, which can "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_194,946569,951930,be directly compared to the results from the interview held with other members. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_195,951930,957871,The use of probes and prompts in qualitative interviews enable the researcher and the respondent 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_196,957871,961850,to enter into a dialogue about the topic in question. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_197,961850,967540,This can be helpful in that the researcher and the respondents are given the opportunity 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_198,967540,975009,to query questions and answer and to verify that they have a shared understanding of meaning. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_199,975009,980699,"Significant latitude is given to the respondent in the shaping of the interview agenda, and "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_200,980699,985879,she or he provides with the opportunity to discuss the topic using the respondent’s 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_201,985879,990780,"own frame of reference, own language and own concept. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_202,990780,996209,This is important as one of the major concerns of researchers conducting exploratory research 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_203,996209,1002449,"is to uncover issues and concerns that they themselves had perhaps, not previously thought "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_204,1002449,1006370,of or had little knowledge of or understanding about. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_205,1006370,1014100,"These interviews therefore, allow respondent to lead the researcher into exploring relatively uncharted terrain. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_206,1014100,1021450,"Using this method, respondents are also encouraged to provide examples in order to ground their narrative. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_207,1021450,1026900,A related feature of this approach is that interviewer will aim to develop some form 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_208,1026900,1029370,of social rapport with the respondent. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_209,1029370,1035040,"In any project involving unstructured interviews, the relationship between the researcher and "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_210,1035040,1038180,those who are researched is crucial. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_211,1038180,1042320,This is considered an essential requirement for this method. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_212,1042320,1048010,"First, without such a rapport, it is difficult to convince respondent to participate in the "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_213,1048010,1051840,"interview, and to talk fully and frankly about the issue addressed. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_214,1051840,1057480,"Secondly, many researcher and in particular feminist researcher, would argue that developing "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_215,1057480,1064030,"such a relationship as a part of wider humanist interviewing approach, assist in reducing "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_216,1064030,1066500,unequal power relations in the research. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_217,1066500,1072060,"Here, interviews are less formal and less structured, and invite the interviewee to "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_218,1072060,1074690,take part in setting the agendas. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_219,1074690,1080600,"There is also a shared exchange of information, rather than the one-way expression of data "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_220,1080600,1086010,"implied according to critics, by the highly structured and hierarchical survey type qua… "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_221,1086010,1087600,qualitative interviewing method. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_222,1087600,1093280,"Wherever possible, qualitative interviewers will tend to aim to reach agreement with responded "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_223,1093280,1094280,to record the exchange. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_224,1094280,1096250,This serves several purpose. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_225,1096250,1101990,"It enables the researcher to capture a full transcript of the interview, which is considerably "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_226,1101990,1105880,more difficult when reliant on note-taking. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_227,1105880,1111730,"This also frees the researcher to reflect more carefully on the course of the interview, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_228,1111730,1117620,"to think about the responses given, and to plan the next line of questioning, and also "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_229,1117620,1123810,to take reflective notes and comments about the issues raised in the interview that might 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_230,1123810,1127730,foo… fruitfully be returned to a later stage. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_231,1127730,1132930,"Researchers should also take notes on any interesting non-verbal data, such as body "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_232,1132930,1138910,language and any particular episode or events that occur during the course of the interview 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_233,1138910,1144140,"that may have a hearing on, how the data should be contextualized and understood. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_234,1144140,1151310,Data from tape recordings can also be open to public inspection by others providing opportunity 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_235,1151310,1159570,for interested peers to scrutinize and either validate or challenge reported findings and interpretations. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_236,1159570,1164220,This will also significantly increase data reliability. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_237,1164220,1169670,Making recordings and full transcripts publicly available also enables others to check that 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_238,1169670,1175780,"interviews have been conducted in a professional manner, with data that faithfully represents "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_239,1175780,1181990,"the voice of respondents, rather than reflecting the values and bias of a manipulative researcher. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_240,1181990,1186140,Then other technique of data collection is the focus groups. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_241,1186140,1190810,"Qualitative interviews that are held with the group of participants, a focus groups "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_242,1190810,1197680,"are done, so with a different purpose in mind, from those held with just one respondent. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_243,1197680,1203500,"The central purpose for both is to collect data that accurately reflects the thoughts, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_244,1203500,1205870,feelings and opinion of the respondents. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_245,1205870,1211460,"However, in focus group the intention is to stimulate discussion among people and bring "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_246,1211460,1216050,to the surface responses that otherwise might lay dormant. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_247,1216050,1221640,Such discussions may enable participants to clarify their views and opinion positions 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_248,1221640,1229020,"or, on the basis of engagement with others to articulate more clearly than they o… otherwise might. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_249,1229020,1236310,The interactive dynamic therefore considered to be a crucial element of the focus group approach. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_250,1236310,1242540,The interviewer or moderator will use a variety of techniques to encourage respondent to debate 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_251,1242540,1248780,"topics and issues, to challenge opinions expressed by others, to identify the areas of consensus "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_252,1248780,1254410,"and disagreement, and to collect examples with which to el… illuminate the concept. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_253,1254410,1262550,The membership of a focus group is usually determined by some shared attributes among participants. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_254,1262550,1267180,"This might be an experience, a known opinion position, a socio-demographic characteristics, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_255,1267180,1268580,or some other variable. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_256,1268580,1275030,"Thus, sum form of the theoretical sampling method is used in the selection of focus group "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_257,1275030,1278900,"membership, so that a degree of homogeneity is evident. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_258,1278900,1280250,This is very important. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_259,1280250,1287400,Too much difference and heterogeneity and the focus group may become unwielded and unmanageable. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_260,1287400,1294110,"By contrast, where participants in a particular focus group share an important attribute, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_261,1294110,1301590,it is or for the researcher to identify shared position and areas of disagreement or potential 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_262,1301590,1308280,discrepancies and contrast broad group opinion with those emerging from other focus group 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_263,1308280,1313030,whose membership is based upon the alternative attributes. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_264,1313030,1319030,"Ethnography and observation is another method, which is very important for qualitative research. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_265,1319030,1323820,"Apart from in-depth interviewing and focus group, the other major method that is used "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_266,1323820,1327200,by qualitative researcher is ethnography study. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_267,1327200,1333160,"Through the observation of institutions, cultures, and customs, the researcher will aim to investigate "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_268,1333160,1339700,"an institution, group or settings that is relatively under-ris… researched and about "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_269,1339700,1341950,which relatively little is known. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_270,1341950,1348010,The ethnographic approach used for this purpose to enquire systematically about the world 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_271,1348010,1351750,people see and to develop theories about the social world. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_272,1351750,1354010,This is an important point to note. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_273,1354010,1359080,Researcher undertake ethnographic studies to see the world in a new way from the point 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_274,1359080,1364400,"of view of the people under investigation, not just to confirm their preconception about "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_275,1364400,1368020,a particular issue or group that they are studying. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_276,1368020,1373920,"This involves looking hard to all aspects of what is going on, not picking out one or "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_277,1373920,1380780,two events and using them to confirm taken-for-granted views about the nature of the social world. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_278,1380780,1386860,"Thus, the ethnographer does not just observe and record the unusual extreme behaviour, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_279,1386860,1393510,but joins in the everyday activities and life of those who are being studied. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_280,1393510,1399470,"The researcher observes social interaction and talks informally with group members, aiming "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_281,1399470,1405040,to acquire cultural knowledge and identify and make sense of patterns of social interaction 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_282,1405040,1407510,in people's natural environment. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_283,1407510,1412680,"This style of research is often referred as naturalistic, and assumed that the study of "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_284,1412680,1419170,people's behaviour can only be conducted in situation where people do not feel under surveillance. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_285,1419170,1426060,"The task of the researcher, therefore, is to observe people in a sensitive and unobtrusive fashion. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_286,1426060,1431870,"Usually, this involves spending time in the field so that the researcher gains acceptance "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_287,1431870,1435480,among the community that he or she is investigating. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_288,1435480,1442580,"Ethnography refers to more than just the process of observing, it includes holding interviews, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_289,1442580,1448960,chats or in-depth interviews with individuals or in group situations whenever and wherever 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_290,1448960,1455180,"appropriate, and may include, for instance, the analysis of documents such as organisational "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_291,1455180,1457710,memoranda or personal documents. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_292,1457710,1464200,The Ethnographic approach may also involve the use of quantitative methods such as questionnaire. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_293,1464200,1469790,"The main research method associated with ethnography, however, is participant observation. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_294,1469790,1475560,Participant observation involves the researcher in becoming part of a group or situation that 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_295,1475560,1480230,"is being studied, although not necessarily as a member of that group. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_296,1480230,1485320,"When conducting ethnographic studies using participant observation, the researcher is "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_297,1485320,1489410,confronted by several practical question. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_298,1489410,1496150,One of the most important decision open to the researcher is selection of a site for a study. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_299,1496150,1501760,"Owing to the time and resources constraint, observations are often limited to only one "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_300,1501760,1507730,"or small number of research sites, and as such the researcher should consider taking "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_301,1507730,1515221,steps to ensure that this or these are typical of the many such settings available for the study. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_302,1515221,1522620,The research will often find several possibilities and the decision should be driven largely 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_303,1522620,1527370,by the anticipated richness of the data that particular sites others. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_304,1527370,1532900,"Beyond this, as an ethnographer you should choose a setting that is relatively easier "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_305,1532900,1539540,"than the others to gain access to, although preferably one that is not familiar, where "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_306,1539540,1547400,you have no particular knowledge or expertise and where you are most open to record the unexpected. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_307,1547400,1553100,"Having selected a site for study, the researcher needs to gain physical and social access. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_308,1553100,1560160,Physical access refers to the process through which the researcher is able actually to enter the site. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_309,1560160,1566650,This may involve the participant observation seeking permission from a gatekeeper to enter 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_310,1566650,1571100,"a particular setting, such as a school or a hospital, and may require some negotiation. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_311,1571100,1577750,"Inevitably, there are political consequences in any such negotiation, and the researcher "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_312,1577750,1583640,"may have to code some power and control over the research processes, and may be required "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_313,1583640,1588990,to compromise some aspect of the proposed research strategy. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_314,1588990,1594950,Social access requires the researcher to gain a vantage point through which he or she can 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_315,1594950,1600280,view the world as it is seen from the perspective of the people being studied. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_316,1600280,1605690,"Having physical access to a site is one thing, but if particular aspect of the life world "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_317,1605690,1611300,"under investigation are kept secret from the researcher by a suspicion community, then "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_318,1611300,1616860,the data acquired will be at best represent only a partial account of the real world of 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_319,1616860,1618380,the culture of organisation. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_320,1618380,1624810,"Finally, there is a stage of recording the behaviour and events that form the basis of "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_321,1624810,1625840,the research data. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_322,1625840,1632660,The ethnographer will aim to record data from her or his observation in the form of field notes. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_323,1632660,1638540,"These will be descriptive accounts of what has been seen and heard, reflective analytical "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_324,1638540,1645030,"notes that focus on then… the themes and patterns that emerge from data, and also methodological "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_325,1645030,1648960,observation such as ethical issues and field strategies. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_326,1648960,1654650,"In general, researcher should aim to take full field notes immediately after an observation "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_327,1654650,1657280,session has been completed. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_328,1657280,1662680,"Such notes should include details about the settings perhaps, maps or diagrams or rooms, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_329,1662680,1664590,where the action has been observed. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_330,1664590,1671420,"Events, people’s behaviour, and talk notes will usually be recorded chronologically and "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_331,1671420,1675830,full details about the date and time of the observed actions. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_332,1675830,1681100,They may also include initial impressions and thoughts about the field work sessions 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_333,1681100,1684770,as well as interpretation and analytical observation.

Module_19_Qualitative_Research_339,1713580,1719600,"At present, there appears to be a more talk of the future possibilities that video conferencing "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_340,1719600,1724190,might offer than its actual use in qualitative research. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_341,1724190,1730100,"There may even be a preference for sticking with text based communication, since one of "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_342,1730100,1736660,the great advantage is that it cuts on the need to transcribe after the events. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_343,1736660,1742980,There is also a large debate around the additional anonymity afforded by text based communication. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_344,1742980,1750220,"First though, we shall turn to a method, which raises a number of questions about whether, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_345,1750220,1754690,what happens online constitutes ‘real’ behaviour that of online observation. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_346,1754690,1760800,"Observing ‘virtual’ behaviour – From an ethnographic point of view, social networking "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_347,1760800,1767810,"sites and virtual communities of offer us insights into how people shapes their identities, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_348,1767810,1774040,how they interact with one another and importantly how they shape their environment. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_349,1774040,1780640,"Space, just like a space, lacks meaning or connection until people makes it their own. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_350,1780640,1783240,A space then becomes a ‘place’. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_351,1783240,1790150,"The ways in which users can define their place in virtual world, by customising layouts or "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_352,1790150,1796690,"even selecting furniture or a virtual house, tells us something about how people construct "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_353,1796690,1800440,meaningful lived experiences.

Module_19_Qualitative_Research_355,1806370,1808940,intriguing topics for investigation. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_356,1808940,1815090,"When using online researcher techniques, all the issues that are discussed in the following "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_357,1815090,1821640,"section apply, but issues of communication, meaning and identifi… identity must also "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_358,1821640,1824270,be given additional consideration. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_359,1824270,1831160,"The practical issue of access to a large pool of data, reduction in transcript time and "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_360,1831160,1836740,"increase participation by excluding groups, offer very attractive advantages. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_361,1836740,1843410,"However, conducting qualitative research online is not merely a matter of transporting conventional "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_362,1843410,1849210,"techniques to the online world, it requires the exploration of a whole new set of methodological "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_363,1849210,1851200,and ontological issues. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_364,1851200,1857160,"Issues in conducting qualitative research studies – There is a issue of validity, "

Module_19_Qualitative_Research_366,1861860,1863030,go to the access. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_367,1863030,1868470,Often the researcher will have to negotiate the access to the settings or people to be 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_368,1868470,1870880,researched with the number of gatekeepers. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_369,1870880,1878050,"For instance, a study on bullying at school may involve the researchers engaging in lengthy "

Module_19_Qualitative_Research_371,1885060,1890320,"governors, the head teachers, the heads of the departments, school teachers, parents "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_372,1890320,1892510,and the pupils themselves.

Module_19_Qualitative_Research_376,1907300,1912460,"However, the issue of political constraint is that of the confront both qualitative, "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_377,1912460,1915950,as well as quantitative research studies. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_378,1915950,1917930,Then comes the question of ethics. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_379,1917930,1923270,This is a particularly important issue in qualitative research where there is a significant 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_380,1923270,1930290,"potential for misleading people, pretending to be genuinely interested, using contacts "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_381,1930290,1935280,"to gain confidential information, betraying confidence and consequentiality. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_382,1935280,1942330,"While physical harm may not be intended within a research design, psychological harm may "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_383,1942330,1949290,arise at any time through the investigation of sensitive issue that may induce stress or anxiety. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_384,1949290,1956080,The researcher must take whatever steps necessary to ensure that ethical conventions are not 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_385,1956080,1961640,"broken, respecting both those who participate in the study, as well as new generations of "

Module_19_Qualitative_Research_388,1975200,1979010,Reflexivity is another thing that we need to keep in mind. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_389,1979010,1985410,One way of addressing these issues is to keep rolling ‘critical log’ or reflex… reflexive 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_390,1985410,1991500,diary for all aspects of the research process including your value and assumption and the 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_391,1991500,1995301,way in which you observe that they may be impacting upon the researcher. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_392,1995301,2002130,"The choices you make in the research, the strategy you develop in the course of the "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_393,2002130,2008180,"research, the various roles that you adopt, the relationship with the people you observe, "

Module_19_Qualitative_Research_398,2032330,2039760,"Finally, after understanding the all the processes of qualitative research, and the issues that "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_399,2039760,2046040,"we need to keep in mind whis… let us summarise, summarise whatever we have studied. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_400,2046040,2051599,"The method that qualitative research tend to use are varied in character, ranging from "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_401,2051599,2056789,in-depth personal or group interviews through to the participant observation. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_402,2056789,2061129,The defining characteristics of these and other qualitative research method is that 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_403,2061129,2067019,"when compared to quantitative methods, they are methods, they are relatively unstructured. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_404,2067019,2072089,"Perhaps, just an importantly in understanding, what is meant by qualitative research approach "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_405,2072089,2075750,"is that, it uses method and sources of data flexibility. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_406,2075750,2082319,"So, while the methods mentioned above are those that are arguably most commonly used "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_407,2082319,2088059,"qualitative research studies, researcher working in this tradition are likely to use whatever "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_408,2088059,2094220,"other sources of data, such as minutes of the meeting or method including highly structured "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_409,2094220,2101180,"questionnaire, they consider are likely to assist them in their quest for understanding and meaning.  "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_410,2101180,2107660,There are a number of issue that researcher must consider when using a broadly qualitative 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_411,2107660,2113319,"research approach, if they are to convince readers and fellow professional and academics "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_412,2113319,2117130,that the findings from their study are credible and plausible. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_413,2117130,2120640,"Chiefly, these concern issue to do with validity, access, ethics, and reflexivity. "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_414,2120640,2129230,"So, students, I think it will be of a great help to you and you have a thorough understanding "
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_415,2129230,2130480,of the qualitative methods. 
Module_19_Qualitative_Research_416,2130480,2136150,To understand the quanity… quantitative methods please refer to the module on quantitative methods.

Module_9_Quatitative_Research_2,42060,47540,I’ll discuss the module on ‘Quantitative Research’. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_3,47540,56360,"When one thinks of quantitative methods, he or she probably have specific things in mind. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_4,56360,64190,"He or she will probably be thinking of statistics, numbers and may be feeling somewhat apprehensive "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_5,64190,69470,because one think that quantitative methods are difficult. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_6,69470,77220,Apart from the last one all these thoughts capture some of the essence of quantitative methods. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_7,77220,85430,"The aim is to understand the quantitative method of research, its meaning, its role, "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_8,85430,95570,when do we do that and to understand its relationship with qualitative research. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_9,95570,105030,The present module helps you understand the meaning and nature of quantitative research. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_10,105030,110580,It also helps you understand its relationship with the qualitative research. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_11,110580,120850,It will make you find out the similar themes between quantitative and qualitative research. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_12,120850,128920,The module will also expose differences between qualitative and quantitative research. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_13,128920,134770,It also let you understand the importance and meaning of it by way of an illustrative 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_14,134770,146030,examples to have a broad review of research analysis process. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_15,146030,149870,What is quantitative research? 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_16,149870,155890,Quantitative research is a systematic investigation of quantitative properties. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_17,155890,163860,"Their observable occurrence and relationship, it involves the use of methodological techniques "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_18,163860,171540,"that represent the human experience in numerical categories, sometimes referred to as statistics. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_19,171540,178780,Personal abilities and personality traits can be quantitative property. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_20,178780,184680,"In quantitative research, relationship between an independent and dependent variable in a "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_21,184680,188510,population is determined. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_22,188510,194560,Quantitative research method can be descriptive or experimental. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_23,194560,200340,"In former quantitative research, subjects are usually measured once. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_24,200340,207590,A descriptive study establishes only associations between variables. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_25,207590,216870,In experimental quantitative research subjects are measured before and after a treatment. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_26,216870,222050,An experimental research establishes causality. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_27,222050,225930,Quantitative research is designed to test hypothesis. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_28,225930,233520,"Factors to be considered in assessing quantitative research designs include external validity, "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_29,233520,240560,"the construction of the sample, the presence of confounding factors, the appropriateness "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_30,240560,247650,"of the pool from which the sample is drawn, selection effects that may arise in forming "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_31,247650,255600,"a sample, the generalizability of the findings, the falsifiability of the hypothesis to be "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_32,255600,261750,tested and the replicability of the study. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_33,261750,269760,"These factors center on whether or not the test conditions whether experimental, a survey "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_34,269760,276860,or an aggregate dataset accurately mirror broader reality. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_35,276860,285310,This analysis will only produce valid results if the data are of high quality in the first place. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_36,285310,294720,"Now, we will dissect the definition of quantitative research to understand it more clearly. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_37,294720,301510,Quantitative research is explaining phenomena by collecting numerical data that are analyzed 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_38,301510,305200,using mathematically based methods. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_39,305200,310570,The first part of the definition is about explaining phenomena. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_40,310570,317160,"This is the key essence of every research, be it quantitative or qualitative. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_41,317160,320830,We seek answers to phenomenas. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_42,320830,327630,"In law there could be questions like what factors influence people to commit theft, "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_43,327630,335430,whether our present system is reforming the prisoners or not and so on. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_44,335430,342169,The specificity of quantitative research lies in the second part of the definition. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_45,342169,347010,In quantitative research we collect numerical data. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_46,347010,353180,"This is closely connected to the last part of the definition, analysis using mathematically "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_47,353180,355560,based methods. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_48,355560,363750,"In order to be able to use mathematically based methods, our data has to be in numerical form. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_49,363750,370610,"This is not the case for qualitative research, therefore as quantitative research is essentially "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_50,370610,376930,"about collecting numerical data to explain a particular phenomena, particular questions "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_51,376930,383180,seem immediately suited to being answered using quantitative methods. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_52,383180,390630,How many prisoners didn't display recidivist tendency after serving their imprisonment? 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_53,390630,397229,What was the timeline in disposal of cases relating to rape against women? 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_54,397229,406099,"Now to answer the question, when do we use quantitative methods, there are four main "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_55,406099,411570,types of research questions that quantitative research is particularly suited to finding 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_56,411570,413690,an answer to. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_57,413690,419030,"First, one that demands a quantitative answer. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_58,419030,425899,"Examples are, “How many patents were granted to Indian multinational companies post two "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_59,425899,432280,thousand five amendment in The Patent Act of nineteen seventy?” or “How many under 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_60,432280,437610,trials are languishing in jail for more than ten years?” 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_61,437610,443860,That we need to use quantitative research to answer this question is obvious. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_62,443860,449270,Qualitative non-numerical methods will obviously not provide the researcher with the numerical 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_63,449270,450860,answer we want. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_64,450860,458740,"Secondly, numerical change can likewise accurately be studied only by using quantitative methods. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_65,458740,465719,Are the numbers of students joining the school has improved due to education policy and legal reforms? 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_66,465719,470540,The researcher needs to undertake a qualitative study to find out. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_67,470540,477830,"Thirdly, in order to find out about the state of something or other, the researcher often "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_68,477830,480789,wants to explain phenomena. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_69,480789,484680,What factors predict the judicial outcomes? 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_70,484680,489800,What factors are related to pendency of cases in the courts? 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_71,489800,496840,These kinds of question can only be studied successfully by quantitative methods. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_72,496840,504219,"Fourthly, quantitative research is specially suited in the testing of hypothesis. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_73,504219,512709,"We might want to explain something, for example, whether there is a relationship between convicts "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_74,512709,516520,and their self-esteem and social background? 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_75,516520,524110,"We could look at the theory and come up with the hypothesis that weaker, social, economic "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_76,524110,530680,background leads to low self-esteem which would in turn be related to the tendency to 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_77,530680,535529,commit crime. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_78,535529,541440,What is the relationship between quantitative and qualitative research? 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_79,541440,549120,"Conversely, qualitative research provides detailed description and analysis of the quality "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_80,549120,551620,or the substance of the human experience. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_81,551620,555970,They share some commonalities both in theory and practice. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_82,555970,562879,"They cannot be called exactly diametrically opposite, both quantitative and qualitative "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_83,562879,570600,"research is both built on the empirical methods to decipher the workings of social, cultural "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_84,570600,573860,and legal processes. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_85,573860,579470,They differ however in how they go about this deciphering. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_86,579470,586810,Regardless of methodological experiences and theoretical differences both agree that social 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_87,586810,591319,research would be based on the real world. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_88,591319,599279,"Interviews, interactions, documents, observations etcetera, in the social world. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_89,599279,606790,"Where philosophy givers may contemplate the very existence of world, researchers would "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_90,606790,612540,accept that there is a social reality worthy of investigation. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_91,612540,619269,They also share the belief that the scientific enquiry shall be logical and consistent. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_92,619269,629300,"Thus, both of them requires systematic adherence to certain rules and procedures. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_93,629300,634930,Then what are the differences in qualitative and quantitative methods? 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_94,634930,643140,"There are differences in sampling, differences in manner how the data is recorded, differences "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_95,643140,649009,"in data analysis, differences in their views and significance. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_96,649009,656120,"First, we will discuss the difference in sampling. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_97,656120,662439,In quantitative research one of the first steps in conducting a quantitative research 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_98,662439,666889,is a selection of respondents or participants. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_99,666889,675520,The precondition of a statistical analysis requires that respondents be selected randomly. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_100,675520,679410,This process is referred to as sampling. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_101,679410,687310,The people and objects selected from a specified population is known as a sample. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_102,687310,694069,"The sample should be large and representative, reason being that small size increases the "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_103,694069,698720,probability of biased result or error. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_104,698720,706120,In qualitative research it is less technical and more about theoretical considerations. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_105,706120,712220,"Sampling techniques in qualitative research are purposive, meaning that the theoretical "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_106,712220,720060,purpose of the research mandates the selection process and not the strict methodological mandate. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_107,720060,724720,"While studying about drug peddlers, random sampling is impossible. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_108,724720,728850,Purposive approach therefore is the only option. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_109,728850,738800,Now we will discuss the difference in the manner how the data is recorded. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_110,738800,747129,Quantitative researchers quantify their observations using a pre-coded form referred to as a survey. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_111,747129,753690,"However, not every study can be done that way because it can have many complexities. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_112,753690,761730,"Say, for example, if we have to study motor accidents, it might be the case that the cause "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_113,761730,770710,"of an accident might be intoxication, which was pre-coded as one or maybe driver, or maybe "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_114,770710,775180,"driver was minor, which was pre-coded as two. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_115,775180,783579,"Now, what if it is both the causes would be marked as just one or just two or both. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_116,783579,789399,"That is the problem a researcher might face, so it becomes necessary to narrate a brief "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_117,789399,794300,"description of the accident on the basis of the count of the victim, "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_118,794300,796069,"onlookers, police reports, and so on. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_119,796069,805360,"So, therein might be a case where it has to be further described using qualitative methods. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_120,805360,812160,The difference in data analysis- The data analysis in quantitative research is based 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_121,812160,816649,on statistics using a formula based approach. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_122,816649,823250,It is an ever expanding and diverse field and can involve analyzing one variable at 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_123,823250,832800,"a time, exploring relationship between two variables or testing relationships among various variables. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_124,832800,840620,"In comparison, qualitative approach is less formula based but rather more emphasis is "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_125,840620,846139,"laid on the context, social or cultural. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_126,846139,855870,"Now, the differences in the views and significance of the two methods- The quantitative research "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_127,855870,860160,is by and large detached from methods. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_128,860160,866499,It introduces a theory initially in order to establish the rational of the research 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_129,866499,874580,and returns to it at the end of the research in order to advance the policy implication. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_130,874580,879820,The concerns are phrased in statistical or numerical terms. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_131,879820,885680,The qualitative differs in the sense that it tends to focus upon the quid pro quo of 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_132,885680,887800,the theory and methods. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_133,887800,899740,"So, it is theoretically more rigorous and much lesser statistical as compared to quantitative research.  "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_134,899740,904870,Quantitative formulation can be explained by way of an example. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_135,904870,911889,The example is entirely hypothetical and does not intend to reflect the true state of law. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_136,911889,918319,There can be factors which the court shall consider in order to decide a case. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_137,918319,925850,"Like, for example, in a dispute concerning copyright infringement the defense of fair "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_138,925850,933560,"use is taken, then the court has to consider the nature and scope of the copyright work, "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_139,933560,941820,"the originality of the work, the amount of copying and economic injury to the copyright owner. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_140,941820,949320,"Assuming these are the only four controlling circumstances, assume furthermore that four "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_141,949320,953540,cases already have been decided. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_142,953540,963350,"In case one, all four circumstances were present and the decision was in favour of the party seeking redress. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_143,963350,970440,"In case two, circumstances one and two were present and the decision again was in favour "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_144,970440,978629,"of the aggrieved party, but in case three, circumstances one and three were present and "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_145,978629,983529,the decision was against the party seeking redress. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_146,983529,990439,"In case four, where circumstances two and three were present was decided in the favour "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_147,990439,993660,of party seeking redress. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_148,993660,1000170,"What decision can be extended , what decision can be expected on that basis in a case in "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_149,1000170,1005050,which circumstances three and four are present? 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_150,1005050,1012269,"Neither the stated rule of law that circumstances one, two, three, and four shall be controlling "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_151,1012269,1018450,for the decision nor any of the decisions which already have been reached offers an 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_152,1018450,1021100,answer to this question. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_153,1021100,1027689,If it can be assumed however that available decisions as well as future decisions form 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_154,1027689,1033939,"a consistent pattern of judicial action, a mathematical model can be designed which provides "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_155,1033939,1037990,an answer to this very question. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_156,1037990,1044680,"In the proposed model, each case will be treated as an equation in which the decision is a "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_157,1044680,1050480,function of the combination of the controlling circumstances in the case. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_158,1050480,1056860,"Accordingly, the circumstances of the case are the independent variables in the question "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_159,1056860,1061840,and the decision is the dependent variable. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_160,1061840,1067770,"In this fashion, the cases which already have been decided provide a set of simultaneous "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_161,1067770,1075640,equations in which the weights of the controlling circumstances are the unknowns. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_162,1075640,1082460,By solving these equations a weight is found for each of the controlling circumstances 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_163,1082460,1089480,"and by substituting these weights in the equation, which represent represents a new case, a numerical "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_164,1089480,1096250,index for the particular combination of circumstances and for the corresponding decision is obtained. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_165,1096250,1104549,"Moreover, since the weights of the controlling circumstances now are known, a numerical index "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_166,1104549,1110440,for any combination of circumstances and for its corresponding decision can be determined. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_167,1110440,1116039,Now we shall discuss something about analyzing the data. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_168,1116039,1120020,The data can assume many shapes and forms. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_169,1120020,1126340,The role of analysis is to bring data together in a meaningful way and enable the researcher 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_170,1126340,1129640,and the audience to interpret it. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_171,1129640,1138370,"The steps are as follows- the first step is to classify the data, the second step is to "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_172,1138370,1149630,"analyze the data, the third step is to find the mean, mode and median of the quantifying data.  "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_173,1149630,1154200,The fourth is to find the standard deviation. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_174,1154200,1162420,The fifth step is associating the data and sixth step is to draw inferential analysis. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_175,1162420,1171400,"First, we will discuss the classifying of the data. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_176,1171400,1178490,"Before analyzing the data, it is essential to classify or codify it. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_177,1178490,1185900,"Before analyzing the data, it is essential to classify or codify it in some way. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_178,1185900,1190720,This is the method of preparing the data for analysis. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_179,1190720,1194370,It is organizing the data to analyze it. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_180,1194370,1202720,"For example, converting the responses in a questionnaire form and coding them in numeric forms. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_181,1202720,1205520,The analysis depends on the data type. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_182,1205520,1213190,"For example, the number of juvenile offenders involved in violent crimes every year in relation "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_183,1213190,1218400,to a particular offence would be a qualitative data. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_184,1218400,1224529,The coding frame is dependent on the amount of data researcher is having and the requirement 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_185,1224529,1227520,of the audience. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_186,1227520,1234799,"If it is concerned with details, more categories are required and if it is a broad overview, "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_187,1234799,1238659,lesser categories would be needed. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_188,1238659,1242700,The second step is about analyzing the data. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_189,1242700,1249250,"The data can be analyzed on a descriptive basis, that is to describe the data. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_190,1249250,1255990,It may also be an analysis that questions the data or tests hypothesis. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_191,1255990,1263760,It is inferential analysis and involves subjecting the data to a statistical analysis. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_192,1263760,1269480,"As far as descriptive analysis is concerned, a researcher shall be mindful about the knowledge "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_193,1269480,1272830,of their audience. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_194,1272830,1278650,"Variables are one of the factors in the data, for example, age, gender, etcetera. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_195,1278650,1281250,They might be variables. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_196,1281250,1286360,A variable can either be dependent or independent. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_197,1286360,1292769,A dependent variable is one that would change following an increase or decrease in an independent 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_198,1292769,1294010,variable. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_199,1294010,1302190,"For example, the exam results can be a dependent variable, in contrast with the number of lectures "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_200,1302190,1306880,"attended, which is an independent variable. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_201,1306880,1315210,The data can be presented in numbers on a graph or in the form of percentages. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_202,1315210,1322190,This type of analysis provides a description of the data which can be easily read as it 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_203,1322190,1328730,is reduced from the mass and have been split upon the basis of various factors. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_204,1328730,1330890,It can be a tally chart. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_205,1330890,1334620,"However, it can further be conveniently reduced to groups. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_206,1334620,1339169,"Say, age groups that uses a five-year category. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_207,1339169,1347200,"For example, figure one presents the age of offenders in auto burglary in the year two "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_208,1347200,1349110,thousand thirteen. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_209,1349110,1356809,Figure two is in the form of tally representing the age of the offenders in one row and the 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_210,1356809,1363240,numbers of offenders of that age in another row below the first one whereas figure three 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_211,1363240,1372210,is on the basis of age groups representing the number of offenders that fall in a particular age group. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_212,1372210,1380159,"Looking at these figures, one can safely suggest that figure three is more informative in answering "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_213,1380159,1385659,as to which age group was found to be most involved in auto theft as compared to figure 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_214,1385659,1390320,one and figure two. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_215,1390320,1397539,"The third step is finding the mode, median and mean of the quantitative data. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_216,1397539,1403620,The mode of a group of data is the most frequently occurring value. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_217,1403620,1410600,The median is the value that separates the upper half of a list of values from the lower half. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_218,1410600,1418880,The mean is the average that is sum of total values divided by the number of values. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_219,1418880,1423200,They are all measures of what is known as central tendency. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_220,1423200,1429200,"One, which best describes the group. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_221,1429200,1435890,The fourth step is to find the standard deviation. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_222,1435890,1440440,Standard deviation is a tool to measure dispersion. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_223,1440440,1447280,"It shows the relation, a set of value has to the mean. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_224,1447280,1451539,Fifth step is of associating data. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_225,1451539,1456710,Some of the researchers’ data would require him to explore relationship between two different 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_226,1456710,1459500,sets of variables. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_227,1459500,1462920,This is also known as correlation research. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_228,1462920,1469970,"There are numerous methods for doing that, but the two most popular methods are Spearman’s "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_229,1469970,1478840,rank order correlation coefficient and Pearson’s product movement correlation coefficient. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_230,1478840,1484179,And the last step is to draw inferential analysis. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_231,1484179,1491680,It assists the researcher in making conclusions about the data by performing certain operations on it. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_232,1491680,1498370,"With inferential analysis, the researcher is inferring from his sample data what the "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_233,1498370,1506880,"population’s scores are, sample is a selection taken from a group, it can be called to be "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_234,1506880,1510159,the representation of that group. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_235,1510159,1516860,"As a result, the findings of the sample can be generalized back to the group. "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_236,1516860,1521809,The population is a group who share the same characteristics. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_237,1521809,1527470,The major difference between differential analysis and inferential analysis is that 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_238,1527470,1533929,the researcher in the former aims to describe the data while in the later he aims at making 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_239,1533929,1539559,conclusions about it. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_240,1539559,1544659,Let us now summarize what we have learned in the present module. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_241,1544659,1552399,"In this module, we discussed the meaning and nature of quantitative research and its relationship "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_242,1552399,1554000,with qualitative research. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_243,1554000,1560830,We have also learnt the similarities and differences between the two. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_244,1560830,1567440,We have also appreciated the importance of the qualitative method of research by way 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_245,1567440,1571690,of illustrative examples. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_246,1571690,1578850,"To conclude, the qualitative research as explained above can give meaningful insights and suggestions "
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_247,1578850,1583870,to the information that is scattered everywhere. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_248,1583870,1591799,It gives us concrete results and indications by performing statistical analysis by converting 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_249,1591799,1596040,the information into numerical formulas. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_250,1596040,1601240,The quantitative research has its own merits vis-à-vis qualitative research. 
Module_9_Quatitative_Research_251,1601240,1602809,Thank you!  
Module_10_Sampling_0,31310,37720, Welcome! This is the module on  ‘Sampling’ in research methodology - course law. 
Module_10_Sampling_1,49310,55720,"So, we are studying research methodology in which we are going to study legal research.  "
Module_10_Sampling_2,55720,62370,"Law, as we all know, affects a society. Law emanates from the society. Therefore, law cannot be "
Module_10_Sampling_3,62370,67649,"and should not be studied in isolation from the society. In such terms, we also can say "
Module_10_Sampling_4,67649,73970,"legal research cannot be conducted in isolation from the society. Now, society is composed "
Module_10_Sampling_5,73970,80220,"of a large number of people in diverse forms, so there are many, many people who are included "
Module_10_Sampling_6,80220,81220,in the society. 
Module_10_Sampling_7,81220,88310,They compose the society and they are all diversified. Legal research is coupled with 
Module_10_Sampling_8,88310,97009,"sociology to give rise to socio-legal research. In socio-legal research, we study the doctrinal "
Module_10_Sampling_9,97009,104010,principles of law as it affects the society and the sociological dynamics or societal 
Module_10_Sampling_10,104010,109590,"dynamics as we might like to call it. Now, where there are a large number of people and "
Module_10_Sampling_11,109590,115860,"we need to conduct the study on them, we cannot be restricted to just books, we have to go "
Module_10_Sampling_12,115860,121790,"out into the field, we have to interact with the people, we have to observe their behavior, etcetera. "
Module_10_Sampling_13,121790,127069,"So in some ways, we can say that we have to have a interdisciplinary approach for legal research.  "
Module_10_Sampling_14,127069,135440,Here is where sampling comes into play. Sampling is the process of drawing out 
Module_10_Sampling_15,135440,142640,a sample from a large population. So a population is composed of a certain number of people 
Module_10_Sampling_16,142640,148250,and from that certain number of people we draw out a smaller proportion and we call 
Module_10_Sampling_17,148250,152849,"that a sample. So, if we have to study the whole population, it may take a lot of time, "
Module_10_Sampling_18,152849,158690,plus it is going to be very cumbersome and not to mention it is also going to be expensive. 
Module_10_Sampling_19,158690,165040,"If we take a sample and we follow a particular technique, the laid-down techniques to draw "
Module_10_Sampling_20,165040,170019,"out that sample, we will be able to come up with a representational sample which will "
Module_10_Sampling_21,170019,175710,"be a, we can say a mini mirror image of the whole population. Therefore, sampling is a "
Module_10_Sampling_22,175710,181299,very important tool in legal research and we cannot do without it especially in socio-legal 
Module_10_Sampling_23,181299,188629,research where we have to deal with population which is as I said large number of people. 
Module_10_Sampling_24,188629,194090,Now there are various terms which are associated with sampling. The first and foremost as I 
Module_10_Sampling_25,194090,201909,"keep saying is population. Population also is conterminously used as universe, that is, "
Module_10_Sampling_26,201909,209859,it is synonymously used as universe. Universe is the entire body of people or the entire 
Module_10_Sampling_27,209859,217299,"body of population that is sought to be studied. So, if we are taking up a social legal research "
Module_10_Sampling_28,217299,223819,"and we have, we are wanting to study a particular trait in a particular group of people, we "
Module_10_Sampling_29,223819,228359,"would call that group of people, let it be ten in number, hundred in number, thousand "
Module_10_Sampling_30,228359,232499,"or a lac, we will call that group of people as universe. "
Module_10_Sampling_31,232499,239840,We have to choose our universe very proficiently according to what is our objective of research. 
Module_10_Sampling_32,239840,248110,"So our objective of research basically steers our universe, the selection of our universe. "
Module_10_Sampling_33,248110,255810,"Now, universe may be of different kinds. One kind is based upon the size of the universe. "
Module_10_Sampling_34,255810,260680,"There are two classifications, one classification is upon the size of the universe, the other "
Module_10_Sampling_35,260680,265660,classification is upon the consistency or the homogeneity of the universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_36,265660,271720,"So, let's take up the first classification. In the first classification, we see that universe "
Module_10_Sampling_37,271720,278900,"may be of two kinds. One is finite universe, another is infinite universe. Finite universe "
Module_10_Sampling_38,278900,285971,"is that universe in which the number of people is countable, it can be calculated or it can "
Module_10_Sampling_39,285971,292210,"at least be seen, we can make a list of how many people are there in that particular universe. "
Module_10_Sampling_40,292210,297060,"In infinite universe, we will not be able to, it is unfathomable, so we will not be "
Module_10_Sampling_41,297060,303020,able to calculate or compute how many people are included in that universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_42,303020,309280,"Now to explain that, I would like to take an example, infinite universe would be if "
Module_10_Sampling_43,309280,314000,"we are conducting a study on a whole country. So, let’s say a researcher wants to conduct "
Module_10_Sampling_44,314000,319270,a study in the whole of India and let us say the researcher wants to conduct the study 
Module_10_Sampling_45,319270,325520,"on teenagers living in India. Now just imagine there are so many teenagers living in India, "
Module_10_Sampling_46,325520,329740,"some of them might be going to school, some of them might not be going to school, some "
Module_10_Sampling_47,329740,333830,"others may be physically challenged, there may be others who may be mentally challenged, "
Module_10_Sampling_48,333830,337570,and some others may be who are involved in some kind of labour. 
Module_10_Sampling_49,337570,344099,So there are so many categories in teenagers itself and it is unfathomable to keep a count 
Module_10_Sampling_50,344099,349650,"of how many people, how many teenagers are there in India. In such a scenario, we would "
Module_10_Sampling_51,349650,355740,say that the researcher is researching on an infinite universe. The other kind is finite 
Module_10_Sampling_52,355740,362419,"universe, as I said, in that the number of people is limited, so we can calculate it. "
Module_10_Sampling_53,362419,367330,"For example, the same researcher wants to conduct a study on teenagers studying in the "
Module_10_Sampling_54,367330,373800,"schools and in a particular city, so he has limited the number of people that he wants to study. "
Module_10_Sampling_55,373800,380690,"Now, another classification that we were talking about is on the basis of homogeneity or the "
Module_10_Sampling_56,380690,387800,consistency of the elements in the universe. Universe is composed of certain units and 
Module_10_Sampling_57,387800,394640,"every unit has certain features, every unit may have diverse features from each other. "
Module_10_Sampling_58,394640,401410,"So, where the units are displaying similar cha… characteristics or similar features, "
Module_10_Sampling_59,401410,407169,we say that the universe is homogenous and where the characteristics displayed by the 
Module_10_Sampling_60,407169,414560,"units are not similar to each other, we say that the universe is heterogeneous. "
Module_10_Sampling_61,414560,420470,Homogeneity and heterogeneity of universe does not necessarily depend upon the qualitative 
Module_10_Sampling_62,420470,427370,"features, it may also be in numbers. For example, a researcher wants to conduct a study in the "
Module_10_Sampling_63,427370,434980,"state of Delhi and in the state of Delhi he has identified certain pockets of areas, so "
Module_10_Sampling_64,434980,441319,"he has taken district one, district two, district three. For example, in district one he sees "
Module_10_Sampling_65,441319,447009,"that there are fifty families living, in district two there are only twenty five families living, "
Module_10_Sampling_66,447009,451990,"let’s say because it is more of a commercial area and in district three, there might be "
Module_10_Sampling_67,451990,453940,hundred and fifty families living. 
Module_10_Sampling_68,453940,459770,"So, he has taken three different pockets and those three different pockets are having different "
Module_10_Sampling_69,459770,465810,"number of people, so we kil… we would call it a heterogeneous universe because the number "
Module_10_Sampling_70,465810,473009,"of people is diverse. In short, homogeneity and heterogeneity of a universe depends not "
Module_10_Sampling_71,473009,479500,"only upon the characteristics displayed by the units, but also upon the number in which "
Module_10_Sampling_72,479500,484650,the units are present. We would discuss all this in detail in the sampling techniques. 
Module_10_Sampling_73,484650,489909,"Now, another important aspect of sampling is the sampling unit, which I just mentioned. "
Module_10_Sampling_74,489909,498191,A unit is the most primary or the most basic part of the universe. It is the thing which 
Module_10_Sampling_75,498191,507250,"is composing the universe, so let us say a person wants to conduct a study in a school "
Module_10_Sampling_76,507250,512900,"on the students, so the students would be the units in the universe and why we call "
Module_10_Sampling_77,512900,518200,it a sampling unit? Is because ultimately the units are supposed to be included in a 
Module_10_Sampling_78,518200,523630,"sampling, I am sorry, in a sample and that is why they are called as a sampling unit. "
Module_10_Sampling_79,523630,529690,So now we know that the universe is there and we have to conduct a study on the universe 
Module_10_Sampling_80,529690,536630,"and we know now that the universe is composed of sampling units, but how do we decide which "
Module_10_Sampling_81,536630,542040,"of these units will become a part of the sample? For that, we need to identify what is known "
Module_10_Sampling_82,542040,548950,"as a sampling trait. So, now let us come to understand what do you mean by a trait.  "
Module_10_Sampling_83,548950,554310,"Every researcher, every socio-legal researcher when he is beginning his research, he has certain "
Module_10_Sampling_84,554310,561310,research questions in his mind or he may have some hypothesis in his research proposal. 
Module_10_Sampling_85,561310,567030,He needs to identify what are the parameters which he wants to study in the population 
Module_10_Sampling_86,567030,573500,and all those parameters or characteristics as we make call it or features of the population 
Module_10_Sampling_87,573500,582400,"will be the sampling traits. So, for example, a researcher wants to study about drug abuse "
Module_10_Sampling_88,582400,588150,"among teenage students in a school. So, what would be his sampling trait? His sampling "
Module_10_Sampling_89,588150,594570,trait would obviously be those children or those parents whose children are into drug 
Module_10_Sampling_90,594570,597720,abuse or have been in the past into drug abuse. 
Module_10_Sampling_91,597720,605480,"So, the sampling trait is the feature which the researcher wants to study in the universe. "
Module_10_Sampling_92,605480,613440,And the sampling trait is what defines whether a sampling unit or rather a unit of the universe 
Module_10_Sampling_93,613440,618070,would become a part of the sample or not. Although there are more technicalities involved 
Module_10_Sampling_94,618070,623370,which you will see further but for now we need to understand that a sampling trait is 
Module_10_Sampling_95,623370,628020,one of the primary things that a researcher needs to identify in the universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_96,628020,635070,"Now, the next thing that the researcher needs to see is called as target population.  "
Module_10_Sampling_97,635070,641130,What is target pop… population? Let us understand that. As I already told you that the units 
Module_10_Sampling_98,641130,646610,of the universe may not all be same. Some of the uni… units of the universe may be 
Module_10_Sampling_99,646610,650630,displaying what we are calling as sampling traits and others may not be displaying the 
Module_10_Sampling_100,650630,657790,sampling traits. So in case the units that are displaying the sampling traits are a fixed 
Module_10_Sampling_101,657790,664560,"number, we say that that particular part of the universe becomes the target population. "
Module_10_Sampling_102,664560,672550,"So, in other words, the target population is what we are going to get once we filter "
Module_10_Sampling_103,672550,678800,"out those units that are not required by us, that wou… that are wasteful for us as a "
Module_10_Sampling_104,678800,684720,"researcher. So, once we have the target population, we know that this is the universe that we "
Module_10_Sampling_105,684720,691680,want to study. Let me again elaborate this point about target population by taking the 
Module_10_Sampling_106,691680,700370,"example of the study on drug abuse. So, this researcher, for example, has a study proposed "
Module_10_Sampling_107,700370,703350,for drug abuse among teenage children in schools. 
Module_10_Sampling_108,703350,710010,"Let us take, for example, that he wants to conduct the study in the Delhi region, in "
Module_10_Sampling_109,710010,717090,"the N C R region of Noida. So, obviously, he will be talking to students who are studying "
Module_10_Sampling_110,717090,724080,"in the Noida schools, number one. Number two, those students must be or must have been in "
Module_10_Sampling_111,724080,730580,"the past, they must have been facing drug abuse. Now another question to be taken into "
Module_10_Sampling_112,730580,737830,mind is that these children or these students may not be very honest with the responses 
Module_10_Sampling_113,737830,741700,that the researcher is wanting to ask. 
Module_10_Sampling_114,741700,746430,So in that case the researcher would like to talk to the parents of such children and 
Module_10_Sampling_115,746430,752770,"and the school authorities where such children are studying. Next, the researcher can also "
Module_10_Sampling_116,752770,759060,talk to counselors who are attached with such schools. So now what do we get? We get the 
Module_10_Sampling_117,759060,767080,"target population that are showing the sampling trait. So, the universe basically is not only "
Module_10_Sampling_118,767080,772290,"composed or it cannot be demarcated by a geographical area. There are certain questions, there are "
Module_10_Sampling_119,772290,777810,certain considerations that are to be kept in mind when we are demarcating universe universe 
Module_10_Sampling_120,777810,785980,and when we are trying to figure out which is our target population in the universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_121,785980,792040,Now an important thing that next comes to our mind is the sample size. The sample size 
Module_10_Sampling_122,792040,799600,as the name suggests is the size of the sample that we are actually trying to draw out from 
Module_10_Sampling_123,799600,805760,the universe. There there might be a possibility that the sample may be biased sample. In such 
Module_10_Sampling_124,805760,816180,cases we need to understand we need to understand that the sample should not be a biased sample 
Module_10_Sampling_125,816180,822620,at all. How can we assure that? We can assure that by following the techniques that we have 
Module_10_Sampling_126,822620,825360,formed for our sampling. 
Module_10_Sampling_127,825360,832080,"Now, let us try to understand what kind of errors can be there when we are doing samplings. "
Module_10_Sampling_128,832080,840180,"Obviously, no human action is without an error, so is sampling. In sampling, there might be "
Module_10_Sampling_129,840180,846470,errors that are caused due to sampling or not due to sampling. The errors that are associated 
Module_10_Sampling_130,846470,851810,"with sampling itself are called as sampling errors, and those errors that are not associated "
Module_10_Sampling_131,851810,856210,with sampling are called obviously as non-sampling errors. 
Module_10_Sampling_132,856210,863070,Sampling errors are caused due to inappropriate use of technique or using a technique which 
Module_10_Sampling_133,863070,868810,is not suitable for that particular problem. As I have already told you that when we are 
Module_10_Sampling_134,868810,875660,"drawing out a sample from the universe, we need to see that the sampling technique that "
Module_10_Sampling_135,875660,883560,"we have employed is according to the research objective of our research. So, if we follow "
Module_10_Sampling_136,883560,889370,"that sincerely, we will not get a biased sample, I am sorry, we will not have a sampling error. "
Module_10_Sampling_137,889370,895130,But in case we do not and we randomly select any sampling technique without understanding 
Module_10_Sampling_138,895130,899430,"what is our objective of research and what kind of sample size do we want from the universe, "
Module_10_Sampling_139,899430,907520,we might end up with a sampling error. Non-sampling errors are those errors that are associated 
Module_10_Sampling_140,907520,913930,"not with sampling. For example, these are the errors that may occur during data analysis "
Module_10_Sampling_141,913930,920100,"or data collection or even while the formation of research design, so one has to take care. "
Module_10_Sampling_142,920100,926620,"But all in all, sampling errors as well as non-sampling errors, they all cumulatively "
Module_10_Sampling_143,926620,933080,"affect the study results. So, what is the need of sampling? We have been studying, we "
Module_10_Sampling_144,933080,936980,"have been reading sampling, what is the need of sampling? The first and foremost need of "
Module_10_Sampling_145,936980,944680,sampling is that it gives us accuracy of results. Now you may wonder that we have a universe 
Module_10_Sampling_146,944680,950390,"to study which is a huge amount of people, a particular group of population and we have "
Module_10_Sampling_147,950390,955490,"taken only a small amount of population from it to study in lieu of the universe, then "
Module_10_Sampling_148,955490,957000,how can the results be accurate? 
Module_10_Sampling_149,957000,963820,"Well, the answer is very simple. The larger the amount of data to be calculated or computed, "
Module_10_Sampling_150,963820,968380,the more are the chances of some mistakes happening because as I already said it is 
Module_10_Sampling_151,968380,977170,only human to make mistakes. Accuracy of results is obtained because we have taken a representative 
Module_10_Sampling_152,977170,982150,sample from the entire body of population or the entire body of universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_153,982150,987140,"While doing that we have made sure, we have applied the techniques in such a way that "
Module_10_Sampling_154,987140,994500,we have made sure that the sample is displaying the characteristics of the universe and it 
Module_10_Sampling_155,994500,1003190,"is displaying the number of people in a proportionate manner. In such a way, we can deduce the results "
Module_10_Sampling_156,1003190,1010520,"from the sample itself and we can generalize those results to the universe. So, obviously "
Module_10_Sampling_157,1010520,1016740,this is one important aspect of doing sampling so that we do not have to conduct the study 
Module_10_Sampling_158,1016740,1018680,on the whole universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_159,1018680,1024780,The second important thing is it is time efficient because imagine that you have to conduct a 
Module_10_Sampling_160,1024780,1032250,"study on the whole of the India, so that would obviously be very time consuming and it would "
Module_10_Sampling_161,1032250,1040980,take a lot of efforts. Conducting a study on a sample reduces time by a lot of times. 
Module_10_Sampling_162,1040980,1047640,"Thirdly, it is cost effective. Conducting a study on the universe as compared to conducting "
Module_10_Sampling_163,1047640,1051810,a study on a sample is but logically more expensive. 
Module_10_Sampling_164,1051810,1058809,"So, when we have to conduct a study on a huge group of population, we will obviously prefer "
Module_10_Sampling_165,1058809,1064269,"that we spend some more time and we understand the technicalities of sampling and therefore, "
Module_10_Sampling_166,1064269,1071590,"we reduce our cost. After all, research work is to be sponsored by our own self if we are "
Module_10_Sampling_167,1071590,1077669,"not going to a research institute for it. Most importantly, the need of sampling is "
Module_10_Sampling_168,1077669,1080640,because it is convenient to do sampling. 
Module_10_Sampling_169,1080640,1087100,"When we apply the techniques of sampling, we are able to come up with a sample, which "
Module_10_Sampling_170,1087100,1094690,"is a mini representation of the universe. While doing that, we are basically studying "
Module_10_Sampling_171,1094690,1100539,the universe but in a more convenient manner. We will still have a large number of people 
Module_10_Sampling_172,1100539,1107750,"to study, yet it will be lesser as compared to the whole of the population. Now, let us "
Module_10_Sampling_173,1107750,1113309,"understand what is the next step in sampling, which is sampling design. "
Module_10_Sampling_174,1113309,1119909,"Just as you all must have known when we are conducting research, the very first step is "
Module_10_Sampling_175,1119909,1126490,"to make a research design. Research design is nothing but the guiding path, the guiding "
Module_10_Sampling_176,1126490,1133710,"light for our research, in a similar way sampling design is nothing but a pathfinder for our "
Module_10_Sampling_177,1133710,1139019,"sampling processes. So, what all things are there in the sampling design? The first and "
Module_10_Sampling_178,1139019,1145809,foremost thing that is there is the objective of study. The objective of our research is 
Module_10_Sampling_179,1145809,1152440,the thing that guides us right from the time of formulation of research problem to the 
Module_10_Sampling_180,1152440,1155450,time we are writing our research report. 
Module_10_Sampling_181,1155450,1161299,"So, objective of study has to be kept in mind while making the sampling design, when we "
Module_10_Sampling_182,1161299,1166769,"are beginning with sampling, just prior to that we should sit at one place and try to "
Module_10_Sampling_183,1166769,1173240,figure out what exactly is the objective of our study or what are the objectives of our 
Module_10_Sampling_184,1173240,1179129,"study because that will as you will further see, that will be very important in understanding "
Module_10_Sampling_185,1179129,1184460,or in finding out which is the appropriate sampling technique for our study. 
Module_10_Sampling_186,1184460,1190929,"The second thing is about universe, we have to clearly define our universe. We have to "
Module_10_Sampling_187,1190929,1197509,"clearly know what all traits do we want in the universe, so we should know what are our "
Module_10_Sampling_188,1197509,1203970,"sampling units and what all sampling units are composed, I am sorry included in the universe. "
Module_10_Sampling_189,1203970,1211910,"So, next step is to define the universe very clearly. Third step would be to have a sample "
Module_10_Sampling_190,1211910,1218460,"size. Now, once we have the universe we can easily come to know or we can easily decide "
Module_10_Sampling_191,1218460,1221190,what kind of sample size do we want. 
Module_10_Sampling_192,1221190,1227770,"Now, how can that be done? Sample size is something which has to be proportional to "
Module_10_Sampling_193,1227770,1234070,the universe. We cannot have a sample size which is which is just fifty percent of the 
Module_10_Sampling_194,1234070,1237799,universe or we cannot have a sample size which is just two percent of the universe.  
Module_10_Sampling_195,1237799,1246879,"In other words, a sample should not be too big nor should it be too small. It has to be sufficient "
Module_10_Sampling_196,1246879,1254309,in number so that it represents all the characteristics present in the universe proportionately. 
Module_10_Sampling_197,1254309,1259670,Next thing that we need to note down are the population parameters which are nothing but 
Module_10_Sampling_198,1259670,1266840,"the vital statistics of the population. For example, census figures or gender ratio, etcetera. "
Module_10_Sampling_199,1266840,1273870,These parameters will help us to understand what kind of universe are we working on and 
Module_10_Sampling_200,1273870,1281900,these parameters will also help us to understand what kind of sample size will we be getting. 
Module_10_Sampling_201,1281900,1286409,Next thing which according to me is a very important step in individual researches is 
Module_10_Sampling_202,1286409,1293820,budgetary and time constraints. Budgetary constraints means we need to plan out our 
Module_10_Sampling_203,1293820,1300509,"expenses, we have to predict what kind of expenditure would we be incurring in the sampling, "
Module_10_Sampling_204,1300509,1306450,while doing sampling as well as after the sampling is done and we have a sample in our hand. 
Module_10_Sampling_205,1306450,1314659," We have to predict those expenditure and we need to also time our whole schedule, "
Module_10_Sampling_206,1314659,1323149,so we need to have a timeframe within which we must focus and we must stick to that time schedule. 
Module_10_Sampling_207,1323149,1327580,So budgetary and time constraints or budgetary and time schedules are something that we need 
Module_10_Sampling_208,1327580,1333080,to plan ahead so that we do not go out of bound neither in terms of money nor in terms 
Module_10_Sampling_209,1333080,1340080,of time. Next thing which is the thing that we are going to study next is the sampling technique.  
Module_10_Sampling_210,1340080,1346120,So what do you mean by a sampling technique? Sampling techniques are those techniques 
Module_10_Sampling_211,1346120,1351519,that are used to carve out a sample from the universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_212,1351519,1356070,Universe is composed of many units as I have already told you and we need to carve out 
Module_10_Sampling_213,1356070,1361879,a sample from it in such a manner that it becomes a mini mirror image of the whole universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_214,1361879,1367049,"Now, what kind of sampling technique is to be used depends upon the sampling technique "
Module_10_Sampling_215,1367049,1372509,"as well as the universe. That is to say, we need to first and foremost find out what kind "
Module_10_Sampling_216,1372509,1378370,"of universe are we working on, that is what is the nature of the units in our universe. "
Module_10_Sampling_217,1378370,1385340,On the basis of that we need to see what kind of sampling technique would we be using. Every 
Module_10_Sampling_218,1385340,1389090,"technique has its own salient features, every technique has its disadvantages, advantages, "
Module_10_Sampling_219,1389090,1395269,as well as every technique has its suitability to a particular kind of universe or to a particular 
Module_10_Sampling_220,1395269,1402950,"kind of study. Now, these sampling techniques basically are the method by which we are able "
Module_10_Sampling_221,1402950,1407279,to carve out a sample from the whole universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_222,1407279,1412789,"Every unit does not stand a chance of becoming a part of the sample, there are only few units "
Module_10_Sampling_223,1412789,1419490,"which stand a chance of becoming part of the universe. Now, depending upon the likelihood "
Module_10_Sampling_224,1419490,1427960,"of a unit to be included in the sample, sampling techniques are classified into three kinds. "
Module_10_Sampling_225,1427960,1434840,"One is probability sampling, another is non-probability sampling, third is mixed sampling. Probability "
Module_10_Sampling_226,1434840,1441389,"sampling as the name suggests is full of probabilities, well, it is not full of probabilities as much "
Module_10_Sampling_227,1441389,1446470,as it gives a lot of probability to each and every unit in the universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_228,1446470,1453350,"In other words, all the units in the universe stand an equal chance of being included in "
Module_10_Sampling_229,1453350,1460399,"the sample when we are doing probability sampling. So, probability sampling is not a sampling "
Module_10_Sampling_230,1460399,1465460,"technique in itself, it is only a classification, but whichever techniques come under the head "
Module_10_Sampling_231,1465460,1473360,"of probability sampling will be, will be sampling from the universe in such a way that all the "
Module_10_Sampling_232,1473360,1478580,uni… units in the universe will stand at an equal chance of being included in the sample. 
Module_10_Sampling_233,1478580,1482460,"So, obviously it is a very unbiased kind of sampling. "
Module_10_Sampling_234,1482460,1488450,Second is non-probability sampling which is the kind of sampling technique in which all 
Module_10_Sampling_235,1488450,1493749,the units do not stand an equal chance of being represented in the sample or being included 
Module_10_Sampling_236,1493749,1499470,"in the sample. In fact, in some techniques none of the units stand a chance of being "
Module_10_Sampling_237,1499470,1504090,"included in the sample. We would look at that very soon. Third is mixed sampling, well, "
Module_10_Sampling_238,1504090,1508840,there are some sampling techniques which are neither purely probability sampling nor purely 
Module_10_Sampling_239,1508840,1510840,non-probability sampling. 
Module_10_Sampling_240,1510840,1516590,In such cases or such sampling techniques are basically then kept under the third head 
Module_10_Sampling_241,1516590,1521679,which is the mixed sampling. A lot of sampling techniques that we are going to see will form 
Module_10_Sampling_242,1521679,1528701,"under a head of mixed sampling. Now, let us have a look at the sampling techniques. First "
Module_10_Sampling_243,1528701,1535559,"and foremost, we will see the easiest sampling technique which is called as simple random sampling. "
Module_10_Sampling_244,1535559,1541600,"Simple random sampling, as the name suggests, is doing of or conducting of sampling in a "
Module_10_Sampling_245,1541600,1545950,very random fashion and it is very simple because it has no technicalities.  
Module_10_Sampling_246,1545950,1554230,"Simple random sampling has only one prerequisite, you need to have a list of all the units in the universe. "
Module_10_Sampling_247,1554230,1560740,"So, let's say you are conducting a study on some number of houses or some number of families "
Module_10_Sampling_248,1560740,1566809,"in a particular locality, you need to have a list of all the houses in the locality. "
Module_10_Sampling_249,1566809,1572129,Now simple random sampling is nothing but the choice of the researcher. The researcher 
Module_10_Sampling_250,1572129,1578080,can randomly pick up any loca… any house or family that he wants to study and he can 
Module_10_Sampling_251,1578080,1585779,include it in the sample. Simple random sampling is completely the researcher’s choice that 
Module_10_Sampling_252,1585779,1592059,the researcher wants to randomly select or he wants to use a particular system in selecting 
Module_10_Sampling_253,1592059,1598999,or he wants to blindly do it or he may ask a child to do it or he may ask his own supervisor to do it.  
Module_10_Sampling_254,1598999,1603250,So it is completely the choice of the researcher what kind of method does he 
Module_10_Sampling_255,1603250,1606740,want to use for doing the simple random sampling. 
Module_10_Sampling_256,1606740,1612419,The most popular methods of simple random sampling are Lottery and Tippet’s Table. 
Module_10_Sampling_257,1612419,1617260,"Lottery, as the name suggest, is a blind method of doing simple random sampling. So all you "
Module_10_Sampling_258,1617260,1623600,"need to do for doing the, using the lottery method is to make a list of all the units "
Module_10_Sampling_259,1623600,1629250,present in the universe as I already said. You name them or you give them a number and 
Module_10_Sampling_260,1629250,1632690,you write all the numbers on small chits of paper. 
Module_10_Sampling_261,1632690,1640559,"You put the chits away, you put them together and probably shake them and either you yourself "
Module_10_Sampling_262,1640559,1645720,"pick out the number of the, requisite number of units that you want because you have already "
Module_10_Sampling_263,1645720,1651780,decided the sample size or you can ask anyone else to do that for you. So whatever units 
Module_10_Sampling_264,1651780,1658659,"you will have in your hand will be your sample. Now, this has no technicality. However, there "
Module_10_Sampling_265,1658659,1664570,is a disadvantage because it may not be representing the universe proportionately or adequately. 
Module_10_Sampling_266,1664570,1670480,"So, it is the researcher’s choice what is a sample size that he wants to do and what "
Module_10_Sampling_267,1670480,1676139,kind of units will he be picking up is completely the luck of the researcher I would say.  
Module_10_Sampling_268,1676139,1681380,Another popular method that came up after the use of lottery method was Tippet’s Table.  
Module_10_Sampling_269,1681380,1686799,"Now researchers had realized during, using the lottery method that it was a method which "
Module_10_Sampling_270,1686799,1692429,"required a lot of time. It was a time when they were no computers, so manually listing "
Module_10_Sampling_271,1692429,1700070,all the units in the universe and then putting them away in a blind lottery would be a lot of work. 
Module_10_Sampling_272,1700070,1706480,"So, lot many research scholars and researches came up with some tables of random numbers, "
Module_10_Sampling_273,1706480,1713340,Tippet was one of them. He came up with a table of ten thousand four hundred numbers. 
Module_10_Sampling_274,1713340,1719240,"These all all of these numbers are numbers of four digits, so he just put them in a table "
Module_10_Sampling_275,1719240,1726340,and what we need to do when we use the Tippet’s Table is this. We assign all our units of 
Module_10_Sampling_276,1726340,1731570,"the universe four digits number, so let’s say a researcher wants to conduct a study "
Module_10_Sampling_277,1731570,1737710,on nine hundred units and he needs a sample size of let’s say five hundred people. 
Module_10_Sampling_278,1737710,1741590,"So, what he will do is to these, because nine hundred is a three digit number, so what he "
Module_10_Sampling_279,1741590,1746571,will do is all these nine hundred people will be assigned a four digit number from let’s 
Module_10_Sampling_280,1746571,1753080,say three thousand to three thousand nine hundred and then he will randomly in the Tippet’s 
Module_10_Sampling_281,1753080,1758499,"Table pick up any four digit number, any four digit number which falls between three thousand "
Module_10_Sampling_282,1758499,1765029,to three thousand nine hundred and then onwards he will simply take up those numbers that 
Module_10_Sampling_283,1765029,1770989,are given in the table and he will go ahead and keep selecting the units in the universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_284,1770989,1775940,"This way, he will not, the researcher will not have to use any technicality in selecting "
Module_10_Sampling_285,1775940,1781270,"the units and it will not be, there will not be any personal bias of the researcher in "
Module_10_Sampling_286,1781270,1788809,"selecting the units, plus there will not be, it will, it is a very simple method of doing sampling.  "
Module_10_Sampling_287,1788809,1795159,"However, it is very random and again just like in lottery method there is the disadvantage "
Module_10_Sampling_288,1795159,1801059,that the sample that is collected may not be adequately representing the universe. 
Module_10_Sampling_289,1801059,1807210,"So, now let us look at other sampling techniques. One of them is interval sampling, which is "
Module_10_Sampling_290,1807210,1813029,"a higher form of simple random sampling, why? Because it is again random, but it is more "
Module_10_Sampling_291,1813029,1820200,systematic. Interval sampling is nothing but selecting units from the universe in an interval 
Module_10_Sampling_292,1820200,1825570,or after a particular interval. What that interval will be is completely to the researcher’s 
Module_10_Sampling_293,1825570,1833240,"choice. So, let’s say the researcher wants to select a sample size of twenty people and "
Module_10_Sampling_294,1833240,1835980,he has a universe of two hundred people. 
Module_10_Sampling_295,1835980,1842429,"So, let’s say the research says that my interval is going to be ten and he makes a "
Module_10_Sampling_296,1842429,1846649,list of all the units in the universe and he randomly picks up any number.  
Module_10_Sampling_297,1846649,1853860,"Let's say he has picked up the number eleven, after that he is going to, after interval of ten "
Module_10_Sampling_298,1853860,1860100,"people he is going to select the units. So, he will have a sample size, the desired sample "
Module_10_Sampling_299,1860100,1865259,size that he wants and he will not have to use any technicality. Plus there will be no 
Module_10_Sampling_300,1865259,1867470,personal bias of the researcher. 
Module_10_Sampling_301,1867470,1874110,"However, this kind of sampling is not very useful in heterogeneous universe because in "
Module_10_Sampling_302,1874110,1880639,"heterogeneous universe different characteristics, diverse characteristics are are present in "
Module_10_Sampling_303,1880639,1887929,"the universe. So, let us look at another sampling, another kind of sampling that we can see or "
Module_10_Sampling_304,1887929,1894239,we can conduct is stratified sampling. Stratified sampling as the name suggests is a sampling 
Module_10_Sampling_305,1894239,1900830,in which the population or the universe is divided into strata. It is a method which 
Module_10_Sampling_306,1900830,1907799,is very useful for those population which are heterogeneous in quality. 
Module_10_Sampling_307,1907799,1913590,These kind of universe which are heterogeneous in quality and which can be divided into homogeneous 
Module_10_Sampling_308,1913590,1920350,"strata, so there might be a population which can be divided into different strata and each "
Module_10_Sampling_309,1920350,1926629,"strata should have homogeneous quality with each other. Now, what the researcher will "
Module_10_Sampling_310,1926629,1932049,do? He will draw out samples from each of the strata using any of the other sampling 
Module_10_Sampling_311,1932049,1938100,techniques that he may like. The final sample which is composed of all the samples from 
Module_10_Sampling_312,1938100,1943100,"the, from each of the strata will be the one that he will be studying finally. "
Module_10_Sampling_313,1943100,1949450,"Stratified sampling can be conducted in two ways- one is proportional, another is simple. "
Module_10_Sampling_314,1949450,1955109,"In simple stratified sampling, as we see, as I have already told you, the researcher "
Module_10_Sampling_315,1955109,1963249,"simply selects from the, simply selects sampling units from the strata, each of the stratum "
Module_10_Sampling_316,1963249,1968769,"and in proportional stratified sampling, the researcher makes sure that the proportion "
Module_10_Sampling_317,1968769,1975450,in which the stratum is present in the universe is the same in which the units from that particular 
Module_10_Sampling_318,1975450,1981580,"stratum are present in the sample, so that is what is called as proportional stratified sampling. "
Module_10_Sampling_319,1981580,1990720,"It is more technical. However, it ensures that the researcher will get a more proportionate sample.  "
Module_10_Sampling_320,1990720,1997980,"Now, next is purposive sampling. Purposive sampling, also known as judgment sampling, "
Module_10_Sampling_321,1997980,2005200,is entirely the researcher’s choice. The researcher is at complete free will to select 
Module_10_Sampling_322,2005200,2011659,any of the units that stand a chance of being included in the sample. None of the units 
Module_10_Sampling_323,2011659,2016059,which are in the sample or none of the units which are in the universe stand a chance of 
Module_10_Sampling_324,2016059,2021340,being included in the sample because it is completely the researcher’s choice. 
Module_10_Sampling_325,2021340,2027039,Researcher out of his convenience or within his convenience may choose any unit that he 
Module_10_Sampling_326,2027039,2035509,he likes. It is very useful in those researches in which qualitative investigations are to be done. 
Module_10_Sampling_327,2035509,2043389,It is not very useful in empirical analysis. Why? Because it may not be representative 
Module_10_Sampling_328,2043389,2050659,"in character, the sample that you finally get may not be very representative of the entire universe. "
Module_10_Sampling_329,2050659,2055200,Another one is convenient sampling which should not be confused with purposive sampling because 
Module_10_Sampling_330,2055200,2061240,in convenient sampling also the researcher himself chooses which kind of units he wants 
Module_10_Sampling_331,2061240,2067960,"to select as sample. However, there is a major difference in purposive and convenient sampling. "
Module_10_Sampling_332,2067960,2075210,"In purposive sampling, it does not matter whether the the unit is convenient for the "
Module_10_Sampling_333,2075210,2079960,"researcher to use or not. But in convenient sampling, the researcher accesses or uses "
Module_10_Sampling_334,2079960,2085540,any of the units that are convenient or that are in front of him to be included in the sample. 
Module_10_Sampling_335,2085540,2093130,"Now all the units that are convenient to access may be included in the sample, but one advantage "
Module_10_Sampling_336,2093130,2098800,of this sampling is that there is no need to have a prior list of all the units in the 
Module_10_Sampling_337,2098800,2105710,universe. It is a very inexpensive method which makes it very popular among the researchers. 
Module_10_Sampling_338,2105710,2109980,"However, convenient sampling cannot be used in empirical researches, it could be used "
Module_10_Sampling_339,2109980,2112160,in qualitative researches. 
Module_10_Sampling_340,2112160,2118240,"Let's take for example, a company which has launched a new product in the market wants "
Module_10_Sampling_341,2118240,2123110,"to know what is the response of the public for that particular product. So, that company "
Module_10_Sampling_342,2123110,2132300,will access any of the people that it wants to or it is coming across any place where 
Module_10_Sampling_343,2132300,2138050,"the product is being sold, the company will take the responses or will take the feedback "
Module_10_Sampling_344,2138050,2144590,from those people. Another important kind of sampling that is done is cluster sampling. 
Module_10_Sampling_345,2144590,2150950,Cluster sampling means that kind of sampling in which the universe is divided into clusters. 
Module_10_Sampling_346,2150950,2157530,"Now, we studied stratified sampling and we saw that the universe was divided into strata, "
Module_10_Sampling_347,2157530,2163540,but in stratified sampling the researcher himself was dividing the universe into different 
Module_10_Sampling_348,2163540,2169790,"stratum. In cluster sampling, the clusters are already available or they are already "
Module_10_Sampling_349,2169790,2176400,"made in the universe. To take a very simple example, let's say a researcher wants to conduct "
Module_10_Sampling_350,2176400,2179850,a study in an educational institution or a university. 
Module_10_Sampling_351,2179850,2185340,"Now, there are various departments that are existing in the university. So, those departments "
Module_10_Sampling_352,2185340,2189920,will have various employees. Let's say the researcher wants to conduct a study on the 
Module_10_Sampling_353,2189920,2197550,"women employees, so each of the department will form a cluster. Now the researcher will "
Module_10_Sampling_354,2197550,2202410,take into consideration all the clusters and he will draw out the samples from each of 
Module_10_Sampling_355,2202410,2205550,"the clusters, that is one way of doing it. "
Module_10_Sampling_356,2205550,2211850,"Another way of doing it is that sampling may be done in multiple phases, that is to say, "
Module_10_Sampling_357,2211850,2219270,"the researcher has already, the researcher has already taken out the samples from each "
Module_10_Sampling_358,2219270,2225240,"of the cluster and he has studied them, then he further goes into the sample, into the "
Module_10_Sampling_359,2225240,2231830,cluster and takes out or draws out sample from them to conduct the study. Another kind 
Module_10_Sampling_360,2231830,2235390,of sampling which is very important is sequential sampling. 
Module_10_Sampling_361,2235390,2242020,"It is a very convenient form of sampling which is also called as snowball sampling. So, sequential "
Module_10_Sampling_362,2242020,2247980,sampling and snowball sampling may be used synonymously. What is snowball sampling? It 
Module_10_Sampling_363,2247980,2255380,means that kind of sampling in which you just simply go on processing or go on collecting 
Module_10_Sampling_364,2255380,2261140,"the data and as you go on collecting the data, you are forming the sample. So, sequential "
Module_10_Sampling_365,2261140,2269680,sampling is more or less a very ongoing process. It does not end. Let us say this kind of sampling 
Module_10_Sampling_366,2269680,2271140,is used basically. 
Module_10_Sampling_367,2271140,2277300,In those kind of scenarios in which the respondents may be a hidden community or they may not 
Module_10_Sampling_368,2277300,2283220,"be very outgoing community or respondents may not be very outgoing in the responses, "
Module_10_Sampling_369,2283220,2288940,"etcetera. So, in such cases the universe may be undefined or may be very ambiguous and "
Module_10_Sampling_370,2288940,2295720,"in such scenarios, it is it is desirable that the researcher takes help of sequential sampling. "
Module_10_Sampling_371,2295720,2303060,"So, for example, a researcher wants to conduct study in a red light area for prostitutes "
Module_10_Sampling_372,2303060,2308440,and let's say the researcher wants to study whether the right to education is being given 
Module_10_Sampling_373,2308440,2314650,or he wants to assess that what is the access to the R T E for the children of prostitutes. 
Module_10_Sampling_374,2314650,2320160,Such kind of places or such kind of people may not be very responsive and it may be difficult 
Module_10_Sampling_375,2320160,2326340,to clearly define the universe for such studies. In such scenarios sequential sampling is a 
Module_10_Sampling_376,2326340,2329000,very useful form of sampling. 
Module_10_Sampling_377,2329000,2335700,"Another sampling that is very important is quota sampling. In quota sampling, we decide "
Module_10_Sampling_378,2335700,2341170,"characteristics on the basis of which we divide the whole population. So, let's say the researcher "
Module_10_Sampling_379,2341170,2349470,"wants to conduct a study for different age groups of men as well as women. So, he has "
Module_10_Sampling_380,2349470,2357540,"taken into consideration let's say age group of zero to fifteen and sixteen to thirty, "
Module_10_Sampling_381,2357540,2364670,"then thirty one to let’s say forty, these are the kind of age groups that he has taken into consideration. "
Module_10_Sampling_382,2364670,2372070,"Now, he will divide whole of the population into those age groups, each of the age groups "
Module_10_Sampling_383,2372070,2377580,"will be called one quota. Further, he will divide those age groups or those quotas into "
Module_10_Sampling_384,2377580,2383080,"men and women because that is the classification that the researcher wants. In such scenarios, "
Module_10_Sampling_385,2383080,2388150,"he will have a particular number of people from each of the quota, so there might be "
Module_10_Sampling_386,2388150,2394930,"X number of men in one age group, Y number of men in another age group, A number of women "
Module_10_Sampling_387,2394930,2398490,"in one age group, B number of women in another age group. "
Module_10_Sampling_388,2398490,2405850,"This kind of quota sampling is very helpful for in-depth investigation. Now, he will calculate "
Module_10_Sampling_389,2405850,2412210,"the proportion of each category to the universe, that is how many men in a particular age group "
Module_10_Sampling_390,2412210,2419770,are represented in the universe and in the same proportion he will take out the sample 
Module_10_Sampling_391,2419770,2425720,"from the universe from that particular quota. So, quota sampling is a very effective sampling "
Module_10_Sampling_392,2425720,2434790,"because units from each category proportionately represent that particular quota, that particular category. "
Module_10_Sampling_393,2434790,2440710,"Now, another important kind of sampling is volunteer sampling, which is also a very easy "
Module_10_Sampling_394,2440710,2445100,"going sampling I would say, because volunteer sampling, as the name suggest, is the kind "
Module_10_Sampling_395,2445100,2451150,"of sampling in which the researcher himself volunteers to be a part of the sampling, so "
Module_10_Sampling_396,2451150,2459750,"he himself will be participating in the research as a… So, he himself will be participating "
Module_10_Sampling_397,2459750,2464440,in the research as a volunteer or as a participant. 
Module_10_Sampling_398,2464440,2468630,"His his own data will be collected by his own self, so don't you think there is going "
Module_10_Sampling_399,2468630,2475190,"to be some form of personal bias? Yes, the answer is yes. So, volunteer sampling is not "
Module_10_Sampling_400,2475190,2480850,"a very desirable sampling. However, in some scenarios, it is very useful because the the "
Module_10_Sampling_401,2480850,2488000,"researcher may be having some kind of inputs which will be useful for his own study, plus "
Module_10_Sampling_402,2488000,2492510,"if he is doing the research ethically and he is honest and genuine in his research, "
Module_10_Sampling_403,2492510,2498510,the inputs can be used and can be put to good use in the research. 
Module_10_Sampling_404,2498510,2504680,Another important kind of sampling is multi-stage sampling. Multi-stage sampling means sampling 
Module_10_Sampling_405,2504680,2512661,"which is conducted at multiple stages. Now, what happens is in multiple sampling we take "
Module_10_Sampling_406,2512661,2518070,"a particular universe, we divide it into different categories of, we divide it into different "
Module_10_Sampling_407,2518070,2524690,"areas, ok . That is one kind of sampling. We have already divided into let's say clusters, "
Module_10_Sampling_408,2524690,2531000,"ok . So, we have done cluster sampling at one stage, in each of the clusters we will "
Module_10_Sampling_409,2531000,2532870,further do some other sampling. 
Module_10_Sampling_410,2532870,2538740,"Let's say we are doing stratified sampling. In each of the strata, we are further doing "
Module_10_Sampling_411,2538740,2543900,"some more sampling, let's say sequential sampling or if not sequential sampling, let’s say "
Module_10_Sampling_412,2543900,2550340,"interval sampling. And in the that, the smaller number of sample that we have now in each "
Module_10_Sampling_413,2550340,2557460,"of the different clusters, we are further conducting sequential sampling and that particular "
Module_10_Sampling_414,2557460,2565260,"final sample will be the one that will be, that we will be using as a as a sample for our universe. "
Module_10_Sampling_415,2565260,2571370,Now multistage sampling is done in those scenarios where we have a huge population which is divisible 
Module_10_Sampling_416,2571370,2576910,"into clusters. I will give a very small example to make this understand. So, let’s say we, "
Module_10_Sampling_417,2576910,2581940,a researcher or a research organization wants to conduct a particular study in the country 
Module_10_Sampling_418,2581940,2586720,"of India. The first thing that they do is they divide the country into clusters. Now, "
Module_10_Sampling_419,2586720,2592120,"we have north zone, south zone, west zone and east zone. So, there are four clusters. "
Module_10_Sampling_420,2592120,2598570,"In each of the clusters, they may do let's say stratified sampling, so the the, let’s "
Module_10_Sampling_421,2598570,2604830,"say we, let’s assume that the researcher wants to conduct the study and one of his "
Module_10_Sampling_422,2604830,2611820,"sampling traits is also geography. So, he will divide each of the clusters, within the "
Module_10_Sampling_423,2611820,2617060,clusters he will divide the clusters on the basis of the geographical conditions into 
Module_10_Sampling_424,2617060,2625260,"different strata. In each of the strata, the researcher or the researchers may further "
Module_10_Sampling_425,2625260,2629330,do purposive sampling or interval sampling. 
Module_10_Sampling_426,2629330,2636790,"So, in other words, the sampling is conducted at different stages and it goes down to a "
Module_10_Sampling_427,2636790,2642710,"very small number of samples, but it is done in such a way which is very technical and "
Module_10_Sampling_428,2642710,2649930,"it is very organized. Therefore, the proportionality may be a question because after all we are "
Module_10_Sampling_429,2649930,2656130,"going from a huge population to a very small number of people. It may be, the proportionality "
Module_10_Sampling_430,2656130,2662760,"may be a question, however, because we have done sampling at multiple stages so representativeness "
Module_10_Sampling_431,2662760,2665700,may not be that big a question. 
Module_10_Sampling_432,2665700,2670990,"Multiphase sampling is another twin brother of multi-stage sampling, the only difference "
Module_10_Sampling_433,2670990,2677240,"between multiphase and multi-stage sampling is that, in multiphase sampling the sampling "
Module_10_Sampling_434,2677240,2684370,"is also done in multiple stages, but at every stage the sample that you get is studied first. "
Module_10_Sampling_435,2684370,2690371,"So, for example, in the example that I gave of India, the clusters that are taken, the "
Module_10_Sampling_436,2690371,2696440,"north, west, south and east zone, each of the clusters will have a particular sample, "
Module_10_Sampling_437,2696440,2702310,"let us say on the basis of strata or let’s say among the clusters, some purposive sampling is done. "
Module_10_Sampling_438,2702310,2708310,"First, a study is conducted on those samples, then the clusters are further sampled into "
Module_10_Sampling_439,2708310,2713941,"by stratified sampling etcetera. Then the study is conducted on those samples and finally, "
Module_10_Sampling_440,2713941,2719660,finally the samples that you get which we have already discussed in multi-stage sampling 
Module_10_Sampling_441,2719660,2725630,"that is conducted in the end. So, basically you can have a comparison of samples within "
Module_10_Sampling_442,2725630,2731800,the universe as well. This is also a very effective method of sampling for in-depth investigation. 
Module_10_Sampling_443,2731800,2737880,"Now, we have studied all the sampling techniques, we have understood their salient features, "
Module_10_Sampling_444,2737880,2744240,"we have understood what kind of sampling techniques are used, more useful for some kind of studies "
Module_10_Sampling_445,2744240,2749070,and what kind of sampling techniques may not be very useful for some other kind of studies. 
Module_10_Sampling_446,2749070,2754400,"However, there are certain principles and precautions of sampling which are common to "
Module_10_Sampling_447,2754400,2756090,all kinds of sampling techniques. 
Module_10_Sampling_448,2756090,2760910,"So, you may take any sampling technique but these principles are to be followed and they "
Module_10_Sampling_449,2760910,2767060,"have to be adhered to strictly. Most important one is we have to clearly define our universe, "
Module_10_Sampling_450,2767060,2774280,so we need to have a clear definition and a clear demarcation of our universe. We cannot 
Module_10_Sampling_451,2774280,2782440,have a vague idea or ambiguity so that it would lead to a lot of ambiguities in the 
Module_10_Sampling_452,2782440,2787510,"sample itself, which would lead to ambiguities and errors in the final study results. "
Module_10_Sampling_453,2787510,2793410,"So, a clearly defined universe is the most important thing in sampling. Second thing "
Module_10_Sampling_454,2793410,2798750,is we need to have a well-planned sampling design. Because we are beginning with sampling 
Module_10_Sampling_455,2798750,2803890,"and we have begun with a guiding light that is a sampling design, we need to be very clear "
Module_10_Sampling_456,2803890,2810050,"of what our sample size should be, what kind of proportions do we want for the sample from "
Module_10_Sampling_457,2810050,2818570,the universe. We need to plan for our expenses and we need to stick to our decided timeframe. 
Module_10_Sampling_458,2818570,2824300,"Next is accessibility of respondents- In the sampling design itself, we need to make sure "
Module_10_Sampling_459,2824300,2828940,that the kind of respondents that we are looking at are accessible or not. In today's times 
Module_10_Sampling_460,2828940,2834050,"of technological advancements, there are many ways of accessing respondents like email, "
Module_10_Sampling_461,2834050,2840600,"telephone calls, video conferencing, etcetera. But in each of the ways of communication, "
Module_10_Sampling_462,2840600,2844770,we need to make sure that the respondents that we are wanting to or we are seeking the 
Module_10_Sampling_463,2844770,2850240,data collection from are accessible and they are going to respond or not. 
Module_10_Sampling_464,2850240,2856410,Next thing is that the units that are included in the sample must be independent of each other.  
Module_10_Sampling_465,2856410,2862010,They must be distinct from each other and the inclusion of one unit should not be 
Module_10_Sampling_466,2862010,2866940,"dependent on the inclusion of another unit in the sample, so they must be distinct from "
Module_10_Sampling_467,2866940,2872340,each other and they must be independent of each other. Next is that the researcher must 
Module_10_Sampling_468,2872340,2876430,conduct the sampling in an unbiased objective and systematic manner. 
Module_10_Sampling_469,2876430,2881750,"We have studied lot of techniques of sampling till now and we know the, the technicalities "
Module_10_Sampling_470,2881750,2886530,"of each of those sampling techniques, we know the salient features of those sampling techniques, "
Module_10_Sampling_471,2886530,2890580,"we know the advantages, the disadvantages of those sampling techniques and we also know "
Module_10_Sampling_472,2890580,2897630,"which universe and which studies are the most use… suitable for. So, we need to know or "
Module_10_Sampling_473,2897630,2902300,the researcher needs to know that this is the kind of sampling technique that I would 
Module_10_Sampling_474,2902300,2907240,like to choose and he has to make sure that the universe that he has selected and the 
Module_10_Sampling_475,2907240,2913240,kind of sample size that he wants as well as the objectives of the research of his research 
Module_10_Sampling_476,2913240,2917650,are in tandem or in line with the choice of his sampling technique. 
Module_10_Sampling_477,2917650,2923020,"So, he has to be very objective, he has to be systematic, he has to be organized and "
Module_10_Sampling_478,2923020,2928390,he has to be unbiased as much as possible because the research without value and research 
Module_10_Sampling_479,2928390,2935740,without objectivity is no research at all. Next is that the researcher must avoid arbitrary 
Module_10_Sampling_480,2935740,2941850,"alteration, so the researcher should not give into that urge of arbitrarily altering altering "
Module_10_Sampling_481,2941850,2946260,"something. If he has decided something, if he has planned for a sampling design and he "
Module_10_Sampling_482,2946260,2950920,"has provided for points in the sampling design, he must adhere to those points and he should "
Module_10_Sampling_483,2950920,2954790,not be lazy in not adhering to those points. 
Module_10_Sampling_484,2954790,2959100,"Sampling errors must be avoided as much as possible, that we have already seen how that "
Module_10_Sampling_485,2959100,2963830,can be done. We need to be very sure of what kind of sampling technique are we looking 
Module_10_Sampling_486,2963830,2968950,"at, what kind of sampling techniques do we want to use and what kind of sample size are "
Module_10_Sampling_487,2968950,2974340,we wanting to seek. Next thing is we need to know what kind of data collection are we 
Module_10_Sampling_488,2974340,2978470,"looking at, what are the respondents from whom we will be collecting data and according "
Module_10_Sampling_489,2978470,2981280,to that we need to select the sampling technique. 
Module_10_Sampling_490,2981280,2986870,We need to be very unbiased and professional when we are selecting the sample so that our 
Module_10_Sampling_491,2986870,2992560,own bias does not come into picture and we do not select a wrong sample. A wrongly selected 
Module_10_Sampling_492,2992560,3000080,sample would in the end affect the study results and it would lead to sampling errors.  
Module_10_Sampling_493,3000080,3006390,"Finally, and definitely not the least important is the objective of the entire research, which "
Module_10_Sampling_494,3006390,3008630,we talked about in the sampling design also. 
Module_10_Sampling_495,3008630,3014380,Objective of the research is the guiding light right from the time when we formulate the 
Module_10_Sampling_496,3014380,3020700,research problem to the time when we are writing the research report and same holds true for sampling also. 
Module_10_Sampling_497,3020700,3024420,"In the process of sampling, we need to constantly remind ourselves or "
Module_10_Sampling_498,3024420,3031150,the researcher needs to constantly remind himself what is the objective of his research. 
Module_10_Sampling_499,3031150,3037700,"Summing up, we read about concept of sampling, we knew about universe, we read about some "
Module_10_Sampling_500,3037700,3043200,"important terms like universe, population parameters. We read about how universe is "
Module_10_Sampling_501,3043200,3048920,"composed of many units and how those units can be formed into a sample, which is a mini "
Module_10_Sampling_502,3048920,3054020,representation of the entire universe. We read about the importance of sampling that 
Module_10_Sampling_503,3054020,3060690,why do we not study the whole universe and in lieu of studying the universe we study the sample. 
Module_10_Sampling_504,3060690,3065880,"Next, we studied the sampling design. There are various steps in a sampling design which "
Module_10_Sampling_505,3065880,3071330,need to be followed for preparing a particular design and we need to follow it. If we have 
Module_10_Sampling_506,3071330,3076370,"a guiding light, we will be able to do our sampling in a very systematic and organized "
Module_10_Sampling_507,3076370,3082550,"manner. We studied various kinds of sampling techniques. Before that, we read about classification "
Module_10_Sampling_508,3082550,3086440,"of sampling in probability, non-probability and mixed sampling. "
Module_10_Sampling_509,3086440,3092340,"Thereafter, we did various types of sampling techniques and we study their salient features, "
Module_10_Sampling_510,3092340,3097150,"advantages and disadvantages. Now, we do know that what kind of sampling tech… techniques "
Module_10_Sampling_511,3097150,3101890,would be more useful for a particular study and for a particular universe. Last but not 
Module_10_Sampling_512,3101890,3106900,"the least we studied important principles of sampling. In important principles of sampling, "
Module_10_Sampling_513,3106900,3112500,we came across some precautions that the researcher has to always take whether he is making his 
Module_10_Sampling_514,3112500,3118240,sampling design or he is conducting sampling by using any of the sampling techniques that 
Module_10_Sampling_515,3118240,3118760,he has studied.  
Module_13_Data_Analysis_0,31230,38000,"I am Deepika Prakash from National Law University, Delhi. The topic of this presentation is Data "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_1,38000,57050,"Analysis under the subject of Research Methodology. In every research, there are certain common "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_2,57050,65250,"steps that the researcher follows. They are, firstly, the researcher defines a problem. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_3,65250,73680,Then he goes on to review the available literature on that problem. Then he formulates hypothesis 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_4,73680,78270,or research questions as the case may be. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_5,78270,84890,"Then he creates a research design, on the basis of this research design he goes on to "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_6,84890,93090,further collect data with the help of various tools of data collection. Once the data is 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_7,93090,102110,"collected, this data is processed, analyzed and interpreted. And then the final step in "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_8,102110,106330,the research is writing of  research report. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_9,106330,114020,Data Analysis is an important step in the entire process of research. Data alone in 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_10,114020,122099,both whether qualitative or qualitative research is insufficient until it is carefully processed 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_11,122099,130069,and scientifically analyzed and interpreted. The present presentation deals with only how 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_12,130069,134120,quantitative research data must be analyzed. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_13,134120,141850,"Now, coming to the meaning of data analysis. Wilkinson and Bhandarkar defines data analysis "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_14,141850,151239,as a number of closely related operations that are performed with the purpose of summarizing 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_15,151239,158730,the collected data and organizing these in such a manner that they will need answers 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_16,158730,167579,to the research questions. Or suggest hypotheses of questions if no such questions or hypothesis 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_17,167579,173659,has been there at the initiation of the study. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_18,173659,182040,"Another meaning is given by CR Kothari, who explains analysis as computation of certain "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_19,182040,190910,measures along with searching for patterns of relationship that exists among data groups. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_20,190910,199609,"He further goes on to quote G.B. Giles saying that “in the process of analysis, relationships "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_21,199609,207390,"or differences, supporting or conflicting with original or new hypothesis should be "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_22,207390,215720,subject to statistical tests of significance to determine with what validity data can be 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_23,215720,219470,set to indicate any conclusion”. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_24,219470,228989,"Now, general understanding is that data analysis, data processing and data interpretation are "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_25,228989,236969,"one and the same. However, this is not true. All these three steps are very distinctive "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_26,236969,245109,"steps in the entire research process. Quoting Professor John Gauing, “processing of data "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_27,245109,252959,"refers to concentrating, recasting and dealing with the data, so that they are as responsive "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_28,252959,260739,"to analysis, while analysis of data refers to seeing the data in the light of hypothesis "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_29,260739,269350,of research questions and the prevailing theories and drawing conclusions that are as amenable 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_30,269350,272440,to theory formation as possible”. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_31,272440,280280,"Now, let us go ahead to understand the difference between them. First, that we are going to "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_32,280280,288180,"understand is the data processing. There are various steps under data processing, the first "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_33,288180,297170,"step being editing. Under editing, raw data that is collected is checked for errors, omissions, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_34,297170,302000,"legibility, etcetera for further processing. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_35,302000,310640,"The second step under data processing is coding, under it assign numerals or other na,... symbols "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_36,310640,319510,"to the answers is done. So, that responses can be put into a limited number of categories or classes.  "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_37,319510,328500,"Now, this coding can be pre or post. By pre poding, coding, codes being assigned, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_38,328500,336490,"while the questions or interview schedule is being prepared that is, before thei,... "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_39,336490,341890,"they are prepared, the codes assigned. Whereas, under post coding, codes are assigned to the "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_40,341890,346280,answers after they have been collected. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_41,346280,355590,Third step in data processing is classification. Most research studies result in a large volume 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_42,355590,362720,"of raw data, which must be reduced into homogeneous groups. If we are to make a meaningful relationship "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_43,362720,370570,"between them. This fact necessitates classification of data, which happens to be the process of "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_44,370570,378990,arranging data in groups or classes on the basis of common characteristics. Data having 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_45,378990,385500,"a common characteristic are placed in one char,... one class and in this way, the entire "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_46,385500,390980,data gets divided into number of groups or classes. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_47,390980,399590,"Now, this classification further, maybe according to attributes or according to class intervals. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_48,399590,407590,"Now, under attributes, they may be based on descriptive characteristics like sex or literacy. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_49,407590,417390,"Or they may be based on numerical characteristics like weight or income. Under a class interval, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_50,417390,424900,classification is based on numerical distinction like the difference in height between five 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_51,424900,430480,"and six feet, the difference of height between six to seven feet, etcetera. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_52,430480,439740,Fourth step under data processing is tabulation. The process of summarizing raw data and displaying 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_53,439740,447290,the same in compact form mainly in the form of statistical tables for further analysis 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_54,447290,456180,"is known as tabulation. It makes research manageable, readable and understandable.  "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_55,456180,460730,"Now, tabulation is essential because of the following reasons. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_56,460730,470220,"First, it conserves space and reduces explanatory and descriptive statements to a minimum.  "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_57,470220,477800,"Second, it facilitates the process of comparison. Third, it facilitates the summation of items "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_58,477800,487600,"and the detection of error as well as a omissions. Fourth, it provides the basis for various "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_59,487600,488640,statistical computation. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_60,488640,497510,"Now, there are two types of table. First is a simple or also known as frequency distribution "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_61,497510,505520,"and second table is a complex or cross table. Now, coming to simple table under it the different "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_62,505520,511360,attributes are stated in the left hand column and the frequency or the extent of occurrence 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_63,511360,522050,"of each of these classed are written in the other column. In this, three things are essential. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_64,522050,530320,"First, the class made must be mutually exclusive. Second, the tabulation must have internal "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_65,530320,537870,"logic and order, and three, the class interval must be carefully and reasonably selected. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_66,537870,548959,"The following is an example of a univariant simple table, meaning that it has one variable. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_67,548959,551899,"In this table, the variant is age. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_68,551899,558050,"Coming to the next type of table, the complex table. Following is an example of a complex "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_69,558050,566029,"table by a multi variant table. They have more than one variable. As in this example, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_70,566029,572430,income and sex of the population studied are the variables. These tables have become more 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_71,572430,576160,popular in the recent researchers. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_72,576160,584060,"Now, coming to how a table is to be prepared, following are certain guidelines on it.  "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_73,584060,591089,"First guideline is, the title of the table. Give a suitable headline to each table, which should "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_74,591089,598980,"be short and appropriate. Second, sub headings and captions, give sub headings to different "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_75,598980,606829,"columns and rows. Captions are given to the various classifications made, like income, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_76,606829,615230,"age, etcetera. Third guideline for preparing a table is the size of the column. Each column "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_77,615230,620540,"must have the correct size, which make them look more attractive. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_78,620540,630760,"Next, arrangement of items in rows and columns. Items must be arranged in one order.  "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_79,630760,640670,"For example, alphabetically, chronologically. Next, total, columns must have different totals, each column "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_80,640670,648550,"having their own totals. Next, demarcation of columns, if columns have been divided further "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_81,648550,656040,"into subgroups, they should be in a suitable order and with sub headings, then footnotes, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_82,656040,661559,if there is anything special about the table of figures which need to be brought to attention. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_83,661559,668809,The same should be mentioned in a footnote to the table. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_84,668809,676070,"Data interpretation, after data has been processed and analyzed, interpretation of data is done. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_85,676070,682410,"Now, there is a fine line of difference between data processing and data interpretation.  "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_86,682410,690689,Interpretation leads to what the given research findings really mean. And what is the underlying generalization 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_87,690689,698839,which is manifested through the data which is collected. Further interpretation may be 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_88,698839,706600,"descriptive, analytical or theoretical as the researcher deems fit. Hence, under data "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_89,706600,713170,"interpretation, the conclusions that the researcher has reached after the data has been processed "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_90,713170,715730,and analyzed are further interpreted. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_91,715730,722770,"Now, there, there are certain techniques of interpretation. The following are the same. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_92,722770,730759,"First, researcher must be given reasonable explanation of the relation which he has founded "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_93,730759,737149,and the interpretation must be in the line of this relationship and the underlining process. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_94,737149,743839,They also must be uniform and coherent in interpretation. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_95,743839,750430,Second technique of interpretation is that extraneous information if collected must also 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_96,750430,757249,"be considered for the final interpretation, they may have a key factor in them. Third, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_97,757249,764819,consult an expert in the field before embarking the final interpretation. The expert might 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_98,764819,771640,"give an insight into the research result, which will further help the researcher.  "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_99,771640,778300,"And finally, all relevant factors must be considered before finishing the final interpretation. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_100,778300,784850,The researcher must not be in a haste. He might come to an inaccurate result because 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_101,784850,786899,of such a haste. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_102,786899,794050,"Now, what are the types of data analysis? Data analysis can be divided into two types, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_103,794050,802439,there is a descriptive data analysis and influential analysis. Descriptive analysis has been defined 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_104,802439,812069,by C Emory as largely the study of distribution of one variable. This study provides us with 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_105,812069,820620,"profiles of companies, work groups, persons and other subjects on any multiple characteristics, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_106,820620,826240,"such as size, composition, efficiency, preference, etcetera. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_107,826240,834250,"Now, an illustration of a descriptive analysis is that, let's say the researcher is collecting "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_108,834250,841480,data from various law colleges in India to map the job preferences of students in the 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_109,841480,850199,"final year of L L B . In such a research, job preferences like litigation, corporate, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_110,850199,855899,"further studies, judiciary, etcetera become the variables. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_111,855899,864220,Tools which are used under descriptive analysis are percentage and mean method. The data under 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_112,864220,871990,"descriptive analysis are then further represented in a graph. Now, coming to inferential analysis. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_113,871990,879670,For testing hypotheses in order to determine with what validity data can be set to indicate 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_114,879670,884279,"some conclusion or conclusions, inferential analysis is used. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_115,884279,890689,"Now, an illustration of this can be that the researcher studying the access to justice "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_116,890689,897579,system in India. And his hypothesis being that the Indian justice delivery system favors 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_117,897579,904329,the haves and marginalizes the have-nots. The data collected is from various stages 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_118,904329,913010,"in the delivery system like police station, Courts of Justice, litigants, etcetera.   "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_119,913010,919850,"Once the data is collected, processed, then the researcher does the inferential analysis to "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_120,919850,925819,test the validity of the hypothesis. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_121,925819,931899,"What are the general characteristics of analysis of data? First, the researcher should keep "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_122,931899,938529,"in mind that analysis will vary depending upon the nature of the study, that is, whether "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_123,938529,945699,the study undertaken is a qualitative study or quantitative study or a mixed combination 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_124,945699,952149,of the both. Second characteristic that the researcher must keep in mind regarding analysis 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_125,952149,959339,of data is that researcher should possess thorough knowledge of the area of research 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_126,959339,960589,and data collected. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_127,960589,967199,"Third characteristic is that the data to be analyzed and interpreted should be reducible, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_128,967199,974050,be readily disposed to quantitative treatment and have significance for some systematic 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_129,974050,981459,theory and can serve as broad generalization. Fourth general characteristic that should 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_130,981459,988059,be kept in mind regarding analysis of data is that researcher must keep a clear set of 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_131,988059,995639,"hypotheses formulated at the very start of the research, which will lead to clearer actions "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_132,995639,1000080,and better data collection as well as analysis. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_133,1000080,1006529,"Fifth characteristic is that in case the data collected is from vague clues, rather than "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_134,1006529,1014170,"according to the specific hypothesis. In such cases, the data are analyzed inductively, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_135,1014170,1021760,"or investigated during the process and not by means of any prescribed set of rules. Six, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_136,1021760,1030640,"for a successful study, the researcher must keep in mind the task of analysis and interpretation "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_137,1030640,1035569,should be designed before the data is actually collected. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_138,1035569,1044959,Data Analysis also includes statistical analysis. Statistics is an important tool for a researcher. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_139,1044959,1051350,"The science of collection, presenting and analysis and interpretation of numerical data "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_140,1051350,1059020,"is termed to be statistics. Statistics is useful in old fields of research and study, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_141,1059020,1067059,including law. In a research with a large data statistics helps introducing such data 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_142,1067059,1073320,"into a more manageable size for the purpose of analysis, and further interpretation. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_143,1073320,1080690,"Now, coming to an illustration, where statistics can be of use to a law researcher.  "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_144,1080690,1089600,"The researcher, let's say is doing an impact analysis of the national security, National Food Security "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_145,1089600,1096029,"Act of two thousand thirteen. In the National Capital Territory, the universe of the researcher "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_146,1096029,1102840,in such a case is Delhi and the population is all the segments of people who are eligible 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_147,1102840,1109950,"for the food under the said act. The tools of data collection chosen by the researcher, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_148,1109950,1112710,let's say is the survey method. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_149,1112710,1119809,"Once the data is collected, the size of the data would be big. Here, the statistical tool "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_150,1119809,1127490,"would be of great assistance to the researcher to achieve his research objective. Now, statistics "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_151,1127490,1135750,"also has certain limitations, which should be kept in mind by any researcher who is employing "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_152,1135750,1139130,statistical analysis in his research. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_153,1139130,1148929,"Some of these limitations are, first, qualitative values like subjective perceptions, qualities "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_154,1148929,1158220,and attributes are not considered under statistics. It only considers quantities. This by far 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_155,1158220,1165929,is the greatest limitation of statistics. Second limitation is that statistics studies 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_156,1165929,1173870,and analyzes group attributes rather than individual characteristics and values. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_157,1173870,1182880,Another limitation of statistics is that statistical analysis is mostly based on average.  
Module_13_Data_Analysis_158,1182880,1191630,"Hence, the inferences drawn through them are only approximate and not exact like that of mathematics. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_159,1191630,1199559,"Fourth, limitation of statistics is that it only helps discover, analyze certain characteristics. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_160,1199559,1207890,"It does not explain the entire picture. Hence, it only forms a part of the inference and "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_161,1207890,1216299,statistical interpretation is part of the larger interpretation of the available data. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_162,1216299,1223210,"Now, there are certain tools which are generally employed for statistical analysis, I would "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_163,1223210,1230800,"name a few. First is measure of central tendency, measuring dispersion, measure of asymmetry, "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_164,1230800,1240039,"and finally, the fourth one, measure of relationship. These four are different types of tools that "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_165,1240039,1249240,any person specifically a researcher employs for the analysis of the data which is statistical. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_166,1249240,1257480,These days statistical software packages are also available. Softwares packages are basically 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_167,1257480,1262620,computerized statistical data analysis. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_168,1262620,1269480,"Some of the packages are the popular ones like SAS , which stands for statistical analysis "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_169,1269480,1278419,"system and SPSS , which is statistical package for social sciences. Now, then what happens "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_170,1278419,1286380,to a data analysis when there is hypotheses in the research. When specific hypothesis 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_171,1286380,1293580,"has been set down, then the major part of analysis involves getting the appropriate "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_172,1293580,1300730,"combination of data and reading them, so as to verify or falsify the hypothesis. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_173,1300730,1308401,"A hypothesis, which is tested for possible rejection is known as null hypothesis.  "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_174,1308401,1314700,The null hypothesis is very useful in testing the significant difference between what was 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_175,1314700,1321740,"assumed and observed value. Now, there are certain precautions which every researcher "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_176,1321740,1327299,should keep in mind while analyzing and interpreting a data. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_177,1327299,1333820,First precaution is that comprehensive knowledge and proper perspective must be there.   
Module_13_Data_Analysis_178,1333820,1340310,The researcher while analyzing the data must have thorough knowledge of the research from a 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_179,1340310,1349440,"wider perspective, rather than analyzing the immediate element of the problem. Second precaution "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_180,1349440,1355650,that can be taken by the researcher for analysis and interpretation of the data is that he 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_181,1355650,1364300,should take into account all pertinent elements. All relevant factors must be considered while 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_182,1364300,1371760,"analyzing. Failure to do so, will make the generalizations drawn inaccurate. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_183,1371760,1378270,Another precaution that the researcher must keep in mind is the limitation of the study. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_184,1378270,1384809,"The researcher must always mention all the limitations in the study, like let's say non "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_185,1384809,1392929,"representation in sampling, bias in the data, inadequacy in the design, inaccurate statistical "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_186,1392929,1395740,analysis to name a few. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_187,1395740,1401740,Another precaution that the researcher must always bear in mind before analyzing an interpretation 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_188,1401740,1410480,"is proper evaluation of data, suitable interpretation of data lies on proper evaluation of facts. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_189,1410480,1416330,The researcher must interpret and analyze the data thoroughly himself for better use. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_190,1416330,1428070,"Now, part of data analysis is also data representation. There are various forms of data representation "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_191,1428070,1433590,"and the primary one and the most attractive one is the diagrammatic representation, which "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_192,1433590,1439700,is user diagrams in representing the data which has been analyzed. There are various 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_193,1439700,1447010,"types of data representations like graph, bar diagram, pie chart, histograms, pictograph. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_194,1447010,1454659,We will look at these in the subsequent slides. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_195,1454659,1463000,"In a graph, there are two axises, the X and the Y, X axis is horizontal and the Y axis "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_196,1463000,1470110,is vertical intersecting the X axis. The point where intersection occurs is the place of 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_197,1470110,1478600,origin. The independent variable are scaled on the X axis and the dependent ones on the Y axis.  
Module_13_Data_Analysis_198,1478600,1485429,In the above example of the graph the growth of female literacy in India since 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_199,1485429,1493289,"independence has been shown. The X axis has the years, while the Y axis has the rate of "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_200,1493289,1496630,growth of women literacy in India. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_201,1496630,1502820,Next example of a diagrammatic representation is a bar diagram. The bar diagrams are drawn 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_202,1502820,1509890,"either vertically or horizontally, each bar indicating the value of the variable.  "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_203,1509890,1518029,"In the illustration, the bar diagram indicates by way example, what was the voters turnout till "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_204,1518029,1524539,the year two thousand ten general election in the state of Delhi. The data is merely 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_205,1524539,1530409,for illustrative purposes. Another type of data representation through diagram is a pie chart.  
Module_13_Data_Analysis_206,1530409,1539620,"In a pie chart, the data is presented in the form of a circle with each category "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_207,1539620,1545679,occupying a segment that is proportional according to the size of its data. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_208,1545679,1552299,"In the illustration, the percentage distribution of the various types of crimes in India in "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_209,1552299,1559039,the year two thousand has been highlighted. Another diagrammatic representation example 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_210,1559039,1566490,"is a pictograph. Under a pictograph, each picture represents a certain number, and the "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_211,1566490,1573500,total number of pictures give the total number of events or elements. Following is an example 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_212,1573500,1579759,"of it, where population of Middlebury from the year nineteen forty one to two thousand "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_213,1579759,1587419,"one has been represented. In it each figure represents thousand persons. So, one can calculate "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_214,1587419,1591450,the total amount by counting them. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_215,1591450,1598600,"Another example of data representation through diagram is a histogram. In histogram, the "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_216,1598600,1605860,values of variables are represented in vertical bars drawn adjacent to each other. The difference 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_217,1605860,1613320,"between a graph and a histogram is that while in a graph points are plotted, and then joined "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_218,1613320,1619919,"with each other. In a histogram, only bars are drawn. A histogram can be transformed "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_219,1619919,1626509,into a line graph by joining the middle points of the tops of the blocks with straight lines. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_220,1626509,1632929,Following is an example of a histogram representing the final scores of the students. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_221,1632929,1640649,"Hence, in this presentation, we saw that data analysis is an important step of the entire "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_222,1640649,1648840,"research process. Through data analysis, a researcher learns systematic and scientific "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_223,1648840,1653389,researching skill and how the researching that has been done by him can be put to accurate findings.  
Module_13_Data_Analysis_224,1653389,1662010,"Through data analysis, the command over various tools and techniques is learned. "
Module_13_Data_Analysis_225,1662010,1667750,And then a more fulfilling and fruitful result of the entire research outcome is possible. 
Module_13_Data_Analysis_226,1667750,1669049,Thank you. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_0,33510,39780,"Dear students. I’m Doctor Manish Singh. I’m from doctor Ram Manohar Lohiya, National "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_1,39780,47239,"Law University, Lucknow. I will be discussing a module on Legal Reasoning. This aims at "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_2,47239,53159,the following learning outcomes. It aims to introduce you to the concept of legal reasoning 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_3,53159,61519,and its importance. It helps you understand the basic components in legal reasoning.  
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_4,61519,69399,It makes you understand the role of logical reasoning in law and it also helps you to know about 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_5,69399,77650,the various types of legal reasoning methods in terms of kinds of arguments. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_6,77650,83160,Legal reasoning as a concept is a process of thinking which helps a researcher to come 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_7,83160,89619,to decision relating to law. Law is a tool of social control that attempts to resolve 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_8,89619,95080,"conflicts in the society, to direct current activity while maintaining continuity with "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_9,95080,102760,"the past, and to control the future by laying down procedures, approaches and theories. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_10,102760,108729,Every decision must be guided and followed by a logical reasoning which takes into account 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_11,108729,115229,"the past decisions and statutes, the present position of the parties to the cases and its "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_12,115229,122750,own impact on future activity. There are four basic components in legal reasoning 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_13,122750,132870,"which applies to legal process. They are logic, justice, experience and policy. Logic refers "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_14,132870,139629,to the internal consistency and equal application of the law. It refers to more than formal 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_15,139629,147940,logic; formal logic is the science of deriving a conclusion from stated premises. It is not 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_16,147940,154709,directly concerned with either true or false. A person can obtain a false but logically 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_17,154709,161340,"correct conclusion from a false premise. Therefore, logic prefers to make correct application "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_18,161340,169599,of precedents and equal application of law. Justice is to do right between the parties. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_19,169599,175400,Experience is an important component in legal reasoning. The life of the law has not been 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_20,175400,183349,"logic, it has been experience. Experience gives power to give good legal judgements. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_21,183349,189519,The last component is the policy. The term policy may be used to describe the process 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_22,189519,195940,of approaching a problem. Policy is used to mean a scientific attempt to peer into the 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_23,195940,203670,future and foresee the consequences of a decision. The use of this approach requires the individual 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_24,203670,209779,to put aside the current interest of the parties and to keep in mind how this decision would 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_25,209779,214190,"affect other persons in future. Now, we will discuss the types of logical "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_26,214190,222459,"reasoning and their principles. Among the above four components that is logic, justice, "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_27,222459,228810,"experience and policy, logical thinking is the core concept of legal reasoning as scientific "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_28,228810,236709,generalizations are based on logical explanations. Every science is based on the principles of 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_29,236709,245349,logic or reason. Science involves the rule of reasoning or use of arguments. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_30,245349,254129,"Arguments are made on the basis of connection, relationship, association, property, common variable, or "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_31,254129,259639,attribute between things and activities mentioned in the argument. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_32,259639,268030,"Arguments can be categorized as deductive, inductive, inverse deductive, analogy and "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_33,268030,276500,"a fortiori. Dealing them one at a time, first, we will discuss the deductive method.  "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_34,276500,281710,The method of studying a phenomenon by taking some assumptions and deducting conclusions 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_35,281710,288710,from these assumptions is known as the deductive method. Deduction is a process of reasoning 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_36,288710,294860,"from the general to particular or from the universe to individual, from give premises "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_37,294860,302170,"to necessary conclusions. Deduction is also known as analytical, abstract, and a priori "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_38,302170,307470,method. It has an abstract approach to the study of science. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_39,307470,313600,Deductive method is a part of the scientific method. It is basically a rational approach 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_40,313600,319650,in accordance with the tenets of deductive logic. Deductive logic uses a general statement 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_41,319650,326470,"as the basis of argument. Core of the common forms of deductive logic is syllogism, which "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_42,326470,334880,"runs like this. Plants grow in day time, a cactus is a plant, therefore cactus plant "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_43,334880,340990,grow in day time. The third statement follows from the first and second statements taken 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_44,340990,345230,"together. A syllogism consists of a major premise, a "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_45,345230,354560,minor premise and a conclusion. A major premise usually states a general rule. In legal arguments 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_46,354560,360910,this is generally a statement of law. A minor premise makes a factual assertion about a 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_47,360910,368400,"particular person or thing or a group of persons of things. In legal arguments, this is usually "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_48,368400,375510,a statement of fact. A conclusion connects the particular statement in the minor premise 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_49,375510,380970,"with the general one in the major premise, and tells us how the general rule applies "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_50,380970,387050,"to the facts at hand. In legal arguments, this process is called "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_51,387050,394120,"applying the law to the facts. Taken for example, to qualify as a victim of rape under criminal "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_52,394120,401020,"law there must be sexual intercourse with a women, the intercourse must be without her "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_53,401020,408490,"will, this is the major premise which states a rule of law. Here, the women had consensual "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_54,408490,415350,"sex, this is the minor premise which makes a statement of fact. Therefore, the plaintiff "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_55,415350,420710,cannot be a victim of rape under criminal law. This is the conclusion which correctly 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_56,420710,426540,"applies the law to the facts. In order for a syllogism to be valid, it must "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_57,426540,432780,be logically impossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion to be false.  
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_58,432780,439590,"In other words, a syllogism is valid if given the truth of a premises the conclusion follows "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_59,439590,447310,"logically, such that it too must be true. An argument is not valid simply because its "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_60,447310,455050,"premises and conclusion are all true. Take this as an example, all teachers are human, "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_61,455050,460750,"some humans are excellent racers, therefore, some teachers are excellent racers. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_62,460750,467960,"If read apart, each of these statements is true. Teachers are indeed human, some human, "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_63,467960,474400,"for example, athletes are excellent racers and as it happens, some teachers are also "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_64,474400,482160,"good racers, but this argument is not valid. The fact that teachers are humans and that "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_65,482160,487340,"some humans are excellent racers, does not prove anything about the racing ability of "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_66,487340,494890,"teachers. Based on the information we are given in the premises, it is logically possible "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_67,494890,500340,that no teacher of the world has ever stepped foot in field for running. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_68,500340,506139,"Because it is logically possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false, "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_69,506139,512060,this argument is not logically valid. The example given above is a fallacious argument. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_70,512060,517610,When researchers propose a study of the casual factors of the delinquencies which are on 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_71,517610,523020,"the increase and which seems injurious to them, they have some general anticipatory "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_72,523020,529560,"idea as to what to be observed, and what specific facts in the main would be relevant to the "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_73,529560,535579,"enquiry, even though they may not have realized these implications. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_74,535579,541980,Then on the basis of their observation they formulate certain single propositions as to 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_75,541980,547860,"the casual factors of delinquencies. That is, they deduced from the complexities of "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_76,547860,554540,"observed behavior certain single idea. In other words, they use a process of reasoning "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_77,554540,561260,about the whole observed situations in order to arrive at a particular idea. This process 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_78,561260,567890,"of reasoning is called deduction or deductive reasoning. The following example, can be sited "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_79,567890,573050,"for the deductive reasoning. Cesare Lombroso, an Italian criminologist "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_80,573050,579770,"and founder of the Italian school of Positivist Criminology, observed peculiar physical features "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_81,579770,585810,among the criminals and by using the logical deductive thinking formulated the following 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_82,585810,593300,propositions by taking his observations into consideration. Criminals are by birth a distinct 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_83,593300,602380,"type of persons. They can be recognized by stigma or anomalies such as asymmetrical cranium, "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_84,602380,610200,"long lower jaw, flattened nose, scanty beard and low sensitivity to pains. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_85,610200,617290,These physical anomalies identify the personally which is predisposed criminal behavior and 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_86,617290,624630,"lastly, such person cannot refrain from committing crime unless the circumstances of life are "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_87,624630,631960,"generally favored. Deduction is logical reasoning, and if we start with good premises deduction "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_88,631960,638420,can serve scientific research in three ways. Number one deduction helps in detecting the 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_89,638420,644451,questionable assumptions logically involved in what is believed to be the truth and it 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_90,644451,650560,implies the number of available hypothesis for formulating the possible alternatives. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_91,650560,657680,"Secondly, the logical deduction of its consequences make clear the meaning of any hypothesis. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_92,657680,664980,"Thirdly, the process of rigorous deduction is an aid in the attempt to steer clear of "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_93,664980,672020,irrelevancies and thus the right principle is found. There are certain steps to be followed 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_94,672020,682240,"in the deductive method. Step one, the exploration of the problem. An indispensable preliminary "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_95,682240,689380,to a any investigation is the existence of a definite problem in the mind of the researcher. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_96,689380,694720,The problem must be one of significance for the actual world. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_97,694720,702230,Step two is about setting up the hypothesis from assumptions. Here the researcher has 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_98,702230,708800,to select the assumptions from which the conclusion will be derived. The assumption must be derived 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_99,708800,717310,from observation; they must be close to reality. On the basis of suitable assumptions hypothesis 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_100,717310,724860,"may be formulated. A hypothesis is a conjecture, a hunch of the possible connection between "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_101,724860,734400,two phenomena. Step three is about theoretical development of the hypothesis; the nature 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_102,734400,741770,and implication of hypothesis have to be carefully analyzed to formulate a theory. This is purely 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_103,741770,750580,"the deductive part of the process; by logical reasoning, we have to deduce the consequences. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_104,750580,757930,"Deductive explanation consist of two parts, the explanandum and explanans. The explanandum "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_105,757930,766339,"is the event, problem or thing to be explained, and is the conclusion of a deductive argument. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_106,766339,773350,It may be an individual event. The explanans is the premise and explain the explanandum 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_107,773350,780920,that is the conclusion. The explanandum is deduced from the explanans. The deductive 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_108,780920,787980,explanation has a valid argument because it takes the form of conditional argument affirming 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_109,787980,797050,"the antecedent, which is a valid form of inference. Step four is about verification of the theories. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_110,797050,804040,"Now, we shall discuss the merits and demerits of deductive method. The merits of deductive "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_111,804040,810930,method are that it is very powerful because it makes use of a valid form of deductive 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_112,810930,820670,"argument where the explanandum must be true if the explanans are true. Further, this method "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_113,820670,827790,is a very simple method. From a ve… few basic facts of human nature a number of inferences 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_114,827790,837810,can be drawn by logical reasoning. It is a substitute for experimentation. It is not 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_115,837810,843790,possible for the investigator to conduct controlled experiments with the legal phenomena in a laboratory. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_116,843790,848370,He can therefore fall back upon deductive 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_117,848370,860020,"reasoning. Another merit of deductive method is it is actual and exact, because the deductive "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_118,860020,866790,method tends for the generalisations which are accurate and exact. The demerits of deductive 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_119,866790,872709,reasoning is that it requires high degree of logic and reasoning. Not everyone can use 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_120,872709,878480,deductive methods successfully and even many experienced researcher have been trapped by 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_121,878480,885720,faulty reasoning. Another demerit is that if the researcher 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_122,885720,892750,confines only to abstraction his model may have the elegance and be logically beautiful 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_123,892750,899380,but it may be far away from real life; thus there is a danger of building inapplicable models. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_124,899380,910980,The theories arrived at by deductive reasoning are valid only under assumed conditions. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_125,910980,919791,"The assumptions must be valid if the theories are to hold good. Lastly, deductive method "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_126,919791,926120,can be application to the limited studies only. The second method of logical reasoning 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_127,926120,930440,is the inductive method. Induction is the most often used method of 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_128,930440,936700,scientific research. Induction is a process of reasoning from particular cases to whole 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_129,936700,944850,group of cases from specific instances to general rules. The inductive method is also 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_130,944850,954560,"known as historical, or expirical or a posteriori method. It may be described as practical approach "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_131,954560,961921,to the research problems. It tries to remove the gulf between theory and practice. This 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_132,961921,969500,"method examines various causes, one after another, and tries to establish casual relations "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_133,969500,974750,between them. General principles are laid down after examining 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_134,974750,980410,a large number of special instances or facts. The method is said to be empirical because 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_135,980410,985600,the formulation of principle is made only after an extensive compilation of the raw 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_136,985600,994190,data of experience. The data maybe historical or statistical data. The historical instances 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_137,994190,1000660,are qualitative while the statistical data are quantitative. Generalizations are made 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_138,1000660,1006420,after the analysis of data. Inductive reasoning starts from observable 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_139,1006420,1015130,"facts from which a generalization is inferred. Let us take an example. Man A died, man B "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_140,1015130,1027000,"died and so on. Thus, all men are mortal. One comes across the death of so many individuals "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_141,1027000,1033600,on the basis of these observed facts one may infer that all human beings are mortal based 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_142,1033600,1039779,"on inductive reasoning. To give an example for inductive reasoning, we can cite the work "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_143,1039779,1045019,of Doctor Goring. He conducted a research on Lombrosian concept 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_144,1045019,1052660,that the criminals constitute a distinct physical type. He made comparison of several thousand 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_145,1052660,1058580,criminals and non-criminals and finds in his investigation that there is no relation between 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_146,1058580,1064911,the criminal behavior and physical anomalies which are proposed by Lombroso. Induction 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_147,1064911,1071270,operates on faith that in the basic course of things if for a long time regularity is 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_148,1071270,1076860,"evidenced, then it is a surety enough for the inference that it will continue in the future. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_149,1076860,1080330,If the premise and conclusion in the logical 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_150,1080330,1087410,"case are both know, some probability relations may be established between them and this may "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_151,1087410,1094230,serve as a paradigm of an inductive inference. Inductive explanations also have explanandum 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_152,1094230,1103160,and explanans. The explanandum is generally probable; explanandum cannot be deducted from 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_153,1103160,1109950,the explanans with certainty. The explanandum is implied by the explanans. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_154,1109950,1116950,The explanans support or provide evidence for the explanandum but does not make the 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_155,1116950,1121980,latter certain. The explanans can be true and the explanandum can be still be false 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_156,1121980,1128110,in the inductive explanation. Inductive explanations explain either the probability of individual 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_157,1128110,1134120,events of stas… statistical generalization. Inductive process examines the particular 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_158,1134120,1140549,phenomena and discovers from them the general law. There are two laws which bind the process 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_159,1140549,1146500,of induction. That is the law of universal causation and 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_160,1146500,1153990,the law of uniformity of nature. Perfect induction is a method of arriving at a universal proposition 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_161,1153990,1160570,and after taking into consideration all the individual instances of phenomena under investigation. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_162,1160570,1166820,Inductive argument derives a generalized conclusion on the basis of particulars which are often 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_163,1166820,1173490,empirically derived observations. The premise of an inductive argument makes the conclusion 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_164,1173490,1178770,probable not certain. The inductive approach relies on the scientific 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_165,1178770,1185540,"discovery of facts. One characteristic of inductive argument is that, it establishes "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_166,1185540,1192790,a conclusion with the content which goes beyond its premise; from the observation of a sample 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_167,1192790,1199520,an inference is made about a whole population. This is called the inductive leap.  
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_168,1199520,1206440,Jumping from the premise which relates to an observed sample to the conclusion which concerns itself 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_169,1206440,1213150,with entire population; the greater the number or presentative units in the premise or observed 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_170,1213150,1216430,"in the sample, the smaller is the inductive leap. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_171,1216430,1223700,The premise of an inductive argument does not establish the conclusion conclusively. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_172,1223700,1229841,The premise of a valid argument may be true but the conclusion may still be false. Its 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_173,1229841,1235600,Its premise only supports the conclusion but it does not make the latter certain. There are 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_174,1235600,1241130,also certain merits and demerits of inductive method. The merits of inductive method are 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_175,1241130,1247300,that it is more realistic because it studies the changes in conditions surrounding the 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_176,1247300,1254710,social activities of man and their effect on social activities are analyzed and displayed. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_177,1254710,1261150,Also there is a possibility of verification. The method is more useful because its propositions 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_178,1261150,1269419,can be tested and verified easily. This method takes full note of the complex relationship 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_179,1269419,1278230,found in actual life and examines them carefully. Another merit of inductive reasoning is that 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_180,1278230,1285400,it is dynamic. This method takes into consideration the changeable nature of assumptions in its 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_181,1285400,1292270,analysis. It does not consider facts to be stable; therefore it is a dynamic method. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_182,1292270,1299400,"The demerits are, it is a very difficult method. This method cannot be used by a beginner or "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_183,1299400,1304751,"a common man because it is impossible for an ordinary person to collect facts, study "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_184,1304751,1313049,them and derive some conclusion out of them. The cost is too much for him. The propositions 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_185,1313049,1320100,obtained through this method are based upon data collected by investigators; therefore 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_186,1320100,1327120,there is a danger of investigator’s bias entering into propositions. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_187,1327120,1332410,"There is very limited scope of verification. Since, the propositions obtained through this "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_188,1332410,1338670,method are based on a few facts; the universal applicability of the proportions is always 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_189,1338670,1347240,in doubt. This method is commonly used for lifeless objects of the physical science. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_190,1347240,1354429,"In socio-legal studies, we study a man’s problems as such the method has a very limited use. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_191,1354429,1360590,If anyone ask which method is preferred the answer is both. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_192,1360590,1367270,"Professor Marshal says, “Induction and deduction are both needed for scientific study as right "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_193,1367270,1375130,"and left foot for walking.” Larrabee remarks, “If extreme rationalist that is reductionist "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_194,1375130,1382270,"is like a spider spinning out theories from within the extreme, expiricist, that is inductionist, "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_195,1382270,1390730,is to be compared to an ant which piles useless heaps of facts. Better than either the spider 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_196,1390730,1398600,"or an ant is the bee, which selectively gathers pollen and transforms it into honey. To be "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_197,1398600,1404500,a bee one has to mingle both induction and deduction in intricate way.” 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_198,1404500,1410210,The third method of logical reasoning is the inverse deductive method. J. S. Mill is the 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_199,1410210,1417030,chief advocate of the inverse deductive method. It is a combination of inductive generalizations 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_200,1417030,1423880,obtained by means of the comparative method or by statistical method with deduction from 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_201,1423880,1430990,"more ultimate laws. It is a way to arrive at reality through experiment, observation "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_202,1430990,1437930,and conclusion. This method starts with the use of deduction and then uses the method 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_203,1437930,1442730,of induction to find out the reason of the phenomena which is under study. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_204,1442730,1448669,The fourth argument is in the form of analogy. Analogy is a process of reasoning between 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_205,1448669,1456490,"parallel cases. In this method, conclusions are arrived at by reasoning of resemblance "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_206,1456490,1462440,where from partial resemblance or agreement of two things or issues to each other. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_207,1462440,1468549,"J.S. Mill says that, “Two things resemble each other in one or more respects; a certain "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_208,1468549,1472770,"proposition it true of the one, therefore it is true of the other. "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_209,1472770,1479570,Case law involves reasoning by analogy. In practice the judiciary proceeds on the basis 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_210,1479570,1485980,of a number of options of resemblance of relations or attributes between cases by applying the 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_211,1485980,1493131,old rule to the new case. A fortiori is other method of reasoning. This 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_212,1493131,1498960,phrase is used in logic to denote an argument to the effect that because one ascertained 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_213,1498960,1506860,"fact exist, therefore another which is included in it or analogous to it and is less improbable, "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_214,1506860,1515200,unusual or surprising must also exists. A fortiori in Latin means with even stronger 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_215,1515200,1522309,"reasons and applies to a situation in which if one thing is true, then it can be inferred "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_216,1522309,1529190,"that a second thing is even more certainly true. For example, if something is prohibited "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_217,1529190,1535910,"then it is assumed that anything more obvious is prohibited. Now, let us recapitulate what "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_218,1535910,1542809,"we have learnt so far in this module. In logic there are two distinct methods of reasoning, "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_219,1542809,1548630,namely the deductive and inductive approach. Deductive reasoning works from the general 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_220,1548630,1557280,"to the specific, this is also called a top-down approach. The deductive reasoning works as "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_221,1557280,1565260,"follows. Think of a theory about topic and then narrow it down to specific hypothesis, "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_222,1565260,1572840,hypothesis that we can test or can be tested. Narrow down further if we would like to collect 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_223,1572840,1580461,"observations from hypothesis. In a conclusion when we will use deduction, we reason from "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_224,1580461,1587289,general principles two specific cases as in applying a mathematical theorem to a particular 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_225,1587289,1592410,problem or inciting a law of physics to predict the outcome of an experiment. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_226,1592410,1599480,An inductive reasoning works the other way around. It works from observation or observations 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_227,1599480,1607770,towards generalization and theories. This is also called a bottom-up approach.  
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_228,1607770,1614679,"Inductive reason start from a specific observations, look for patterns or no patterns, regularities "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_229,1614679,1622559,"or irregularities, formulate hypothesis that one could work with and finally ended up developing "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_230,1622559,1630690,"general theories or drawing conclusion. In a conclusion when one use induction, he "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_231,1630690,1636240,observes a number of specific instances and from them infer a general principle of law. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_232,1636240,1642700,"These two methods are very different in nature when used in conducting researches, other "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_233,1642700,1651120,"than being top-down and bottom-up. Inductive reasoning is open ended and exploratory, especially "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_234,1651120,1657160,"at the beginning. On the other hand, deductive reasoning is narrow in nature and is concerned "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_235,1657160,1665429,"with testing or confirming hypothesis. Comparing the two reasoning, we first recollect the "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_236,1665429,1671650,properties of deduction. In a valid deductive argument all of the content 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_237,1671650,1679830,"of the conclusion is present, at least implicitly in the premises. If the premises are true "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_238,1679830,1687550,"the conclusion must be true, valid deduction is necessarily truth preserving. If new premises "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_239,1687550,1694010,"are added to a valid deductive argument, the argument remains valid. Deduction is erosion "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_240,1694010,1701390,proof; deductive validity is an all or nothing matter. The conclusion of an inductive argument 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_241,1701390,1706180,has content that goes beyond the content of its premises. 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_242,1706180,1713910,A correct inductive argument may have true premises and a false conclusion.  
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_243,1713910,1720750,Induction is not necessarily truth preserving. New premises may completely undermine a strong inductive argument.  
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_244,1720750,1727580,Induction is not erosion proof. Inductive arguments come in different degrees 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_245,1727580,1733850,of strength. In some inductions the premises support the conclusions more strongly than 
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_246,1733850,1740600,"in others, but some philosophers have doubt that induction is really a method of logical "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_247,1740600,1746650,"reasoning, since observations of past instances may never be sufficient to give a certainty "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_248,1746650,1754580,"about what will happen in future. For example, observing billions of billions of white swans "
Module_3_Legal_Reasoning_249,1754580,1758610,does not imply that all swans are white. Thank you!

Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_20,169690,177190,research such as the black letter tradition. Its methodology is predominantly empirical 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_21,177190,184840,and social-theoretical rather than doctrinal. Law is not merely a black letter rather it 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_22,184840,190810,is an instrument of social control. It originates and functions in a society and

Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_24,198060,204019,surround its implementation cannot be studied in a better manner without the sociological 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_25,204019,212310,"enquiry. Law is an important variable in any social investigation, researchers cannot do "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_26,212310,218310,"anything in sociological research if they do not know at least the basics of law, legal "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_27,218310,224759,"system and law institutions. Similarly, a legal researcher cannot do justice "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_28,224759,232360,to the legal enquiry if he does not know about the mechanics of socio-legal research methods. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_29,232360,238229,In a plan development of the society law is playing the role of a catalyst to help in 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_30,238229,244479,the process of social change. In a dynamic society a legal research must switch over 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_31,244479,250700,to multi or interdisciplinary approach as to legal problems as these are connected with 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_32,250700,255480,"social, political, economic and psychological issues. "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_33,255480,262009,The key elements of socio-legal research are to undertake theoretical and empirical analysis 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_34,262009,267830,of the nature of law and its relationship to society and the state in the context of 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_35,267830,275880,"rapidly changing world. Analyze both historical and contemporary of the social, economic and "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_36,275880,282360,political factors leading to the development of the law and legal process. An examination 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_37,282360,288909,"of the operation of the law in formal context; for example, the courts or in informal context, "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_38,288909,294530,"for example, the law office. An analysis of the process of decision making "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_39,294530,301360,by those responsible for the administration of the law and lastly an analysis of the experience 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_40,301360,310509,of those effected by the process of law. The utility of socio-legal research are following: 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_41,310509,316610,Socio-legal research can be useful in formulating new theories. Socio-legal research gives clue 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_42,316610,324920,"to the decision making, socio-legal research gives a lead and molds public opinion, socio-legal "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_43,324920,331740,research is useful in framing new laws. Socio-legal research is useful in finding

Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_48,359789,365180,research is or interdisciplinary approach which extends into the fields of all social sciences. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_49,365180,369819,Professor Upendra Baxi proposed the socio-legal 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_50,369819,377279,"research in the following vital areas. First, mapping of Indian legal system and formal "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_51,377279,384180,"and informal legal systems. Secondly, studies on the beneficiaries and victims of administration "

Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_55,405340,412840,We can add some more specific areas of socio-legal research such as directive principles of constitution 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_56,412840,419349,of India and effect of their implementation. Criminal tendency in some tribes and sections 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_57,419349,426419,"in India. Tax imposition and social change, international economic law and the increase "

Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_61,449080,456419,"and their effect on social life, feeble mindedness and criminality and many more of the like. "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_62,456419,462270,The different approaches to socio-legal research – A socio-legal approach may be seen to 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_63,462270,470330,occupy space between two extremes of methodological spectrum. At one end a strict doctrinal approach 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_64,470330,476039,relies predominantly on self-informed analysis of legislation and judicial decisions from 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_65,476039,480499,the superior courts. Approaches at the other end such as critical 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_66,480499,487349,"legal studies and economic analysis of law are tuned to the concerns, theory and informants "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_67,487349,493629,of external perspectives. While contextual analysis is increasingly the norm in legal 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_68,493629,500349,"scholarship, external informants are essential to a socio-legal approach. The socio-legal "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_69,500349,508080,lens widens to observe operational and everyday legal situations and diverse at textual so… 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_70,508080,511300,disciplinary and culture perspectives are considered. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_71,511300,520300,"Now a brief discussion about a socio-legal field. H. L. A Harts Concept of Law, offers "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_72,520300,526820,an accessible analysis of a mature legal order which is attuned to law’s social character 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_73,526820,532320,and its role in ordering a society. The key concepts in Harts account of law or social 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_74,532320,539210,rules of which legal rules are one kind and the acceptance of law by officials. It examines 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_75,539210,546139,"the notion of social rule, what it means to accept a rule and the rule of recognition "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_76,546139,552089,as the master rule of legal order. The role of officials in a legal order and 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_77,552089,559840,"Harts contrast between officials and citizens. At this point the question arises, as to whether "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_78,559840,566089,there are other systems of law besides state law and if so why prominence is given to state 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_79,566089,573910,law? This leads to questions about legal pluralism by which is meant different legal orders existing 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_80,573910,582579,side by side or overlapping or one dominating another. Understanding law and legal system 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_81,582579,588699,as a social formation is the first part of a law and society approach. The second is 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_82,588699,593529,the interrelationship between law and the other aspects of society. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_83,593529,600000,"One issue is how, one issue is how law as a system of social rule interacts with other "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_84,600000,607820,"system of social rules such as those of civil associations, religious bodies, private institutions, "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_85,607820,615500,family networks and so on. What happens when legal rules conflict with or try to change 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_86,615500,621410,other networks of rules? Here the notion of social sphere is developed and put to use 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_87,621410,628269,in explaining the interrelationship. In developing this analysis law needs to be broken down 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_88,628269,634900,"into different kinds of laws such as criminal, civil, constitutional and regulation. "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_89,634900,641230,"The last issue is about the effectiveness of law, if a state law is explained and justified "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_90,641230,646980,on the basis that it has certain social advantage over systems of social rules then the assumption 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_91,646980,653850,"is that law is effective in influencing behavior. Here notions of implementation, compliance "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_92,653850,661319,"and enforcement come into picture. Now, what is the political science approach? The first "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_93,661319,669130,approach is about legal mobilization. There exist a complex relationship between law and 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_94,669130,673819,social movements. Social movement actors use a wide range of 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_95,673819,681949,"legal tactics including lobbying, litigation and administrative advocacy in their campaign "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_96,681949,689660,"for social, political and economic change. On one hand movements rely on rights to frame "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_97,689660,696540,"their grievances, to define and reinforce collective identity and to mobilize activist. "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_98,696540,701759,The realm of the law can provide social reforms campaigns with opportunities to influence 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_99,701759,709509,policy regulation and enforcement practices. On the other hand the use of legal strategies 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_100,709509,716319,"and reliance on lawyers can exert a conservative pressure on social movements, channeling protest "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_101,716319,724639,and other forms of radical action into conventional political and legal institutions. These tensions 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_102,724639,730380,inherent in legal mobilization activity have raised a number of theoretical and empirical 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_103,730380,736259,questions. What are the conditions under which individual and collective actors will turn 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_104,736259,743209,to the courts to pursue political or social goals? What is the best way for researchers 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_105,743209,748900,"interested in social movements to determine social movement success within the courts, "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_106,748900,754319,within the policy realm and beyond? What is the impact of legal mobilization on 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_107,754319,760459,a social movement’s collective identity? The literature on the mobilization of law 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_108,760459,767279,a social movements by providing a bottom of perspective draws on compliments and provides 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_109,767279,776690,alternatives to courts center studies of social reform. The second approach concentrates on 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_110,776690,784230,"judicial review and human rights, political science approaches to the study of law particularly "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_111,784230,789140,explores how political science can be applied to study the role of courts in protecting 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_112,789140,795100,human rights. The third approach concerns itself with the 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_113,795100,801399,"role of courts in democracy, the judiciary is a high-impact institution. When functioning "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_114,801399,808089,"properly it profoundly affects social-well-being, facilitating economic development and shielding "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_115,808089,815350,the individual from arbitrary state power. In countries transitioning from authoritarian 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_116,815350,822610,rule to democracy a judiciary empower to vindicate the constitution is by consensus regarded 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_117,822610,828889,as essential to democratic consolidation. Given the important role courts are believed 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_118,828889,835800,"to play, it is not surprising that sociologists and political scientists have in recent decades "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_119,835800,843160,"paid ever more attention to judicial affairs. One post world war second trend identified, "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_120,843160,848750,documented and analyzed by a diverse sub-group of these investigators stands out for its 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_121,848750,858290,ubiquity namely the worldwide expansion of both domestic and supranational judicial power. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_122,858290,864339,Informed by a paradigm that blames the vulnerabilities of parliamentary democracy for world war second 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_123,864339,869870,"and its horrors, many have come to see the judiciary as a check on the alleged evils "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_124,869870,876860,of untrammeled democracy. In one jurisdiction after another even in the most conservative 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_125,876860,882699,and authoritarian civil law traditions courts have been empowered or have empowered themselves 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_126,882699,888839,"to strike down with finality statues of Parliament and even plebiscites, which they interpret "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_127,888839,894730,to be unconstitutional. The judicial assumption of power not merely 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_128,894730,900940,to nullify democratically enacted legislation but also to legislate new general norms in 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_129,900940,907319,all areas of life has taken judges far beyond their classical function of reviewing cases 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_130,907319,914399,with the rights of persons are in jeopardy. A range of theoretical questions and long 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_131,914399,920220,standing controversies can be seen in this like what ought to be the role of courts in 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_132,920220,926899,a democratic society? Ought judges to intervene in policy processes or should they confine 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_133,926899,932430,themselves to deciding the guilt or innocence of individual persons. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_134,932430,938839,Is judicial supremacy incompatible with the democratic ideal of po… popular sovereignty? 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_135,938839,946079,If activism becomes excessive how and by whom ought it to be curtailed? Do any alternatives 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_136,946079,951639,to the judicialization of politics exist that are more compatible with democracy yet do 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_137,951639,957970,"not compromise the rule of law? Now, sh… we shall discuss the sociological approaches "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_138,957970,965230,to the socio-legal research. The first approach places law in the socio-legal and socio-cultural context. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_139,965230,969639,This explores the way in which the framework 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_140,969639,976860,of cultural relativism can assist the exploration of law and a social construct. The factors 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_141,976860,982999,"affecting that process includes historically formed traditions, existing institutional "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_142,982999,991320,settings and contemporary changes. Legal cultures affect the development process in transitional 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_143,991320,998300,societies. As far as methodological issues are concerned there are relative merits of 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_144,998300,1005420,using qualitative and quantitative methods together research data. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_145,1005420,1012920,"The second approach ask a question, can law control? The law acts as a would-be instrument "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_146,1012920,1019319,"of control, demonstrating the social and legal factors that influence its implementation "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_147,1019319,1026640,"and enforcement, and addressing the problematic notion of compliance and the areas of business "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_148,1026640,1034150,regulation. There can also be alternative perspective as well and researcher shall focus 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_149,1034150,1041220,on thinking outside the box in order to inform conventional wisdom and to formulate perspective 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_150,1041220,1047260,"and new questions for research. Now to discuss the anthropological approach, "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_151,1047260,1054850,which means generally the law beyond government. How shall we understand the different types 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_152,1054850,1061000,and systems of law that occur throughout the world? By considering radically different 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_153,1061000,1068580,"examples of law beyond government, what conclusions can we draw about the nature of law itself? "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_154,1068580,1074020,There are examples of the approaches that anthropologists have taken to law in other 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_155,1074020,1080770,"societies and cultures, including informal systems of law and dispute resolution. "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_156,1080770,1087279,There exist examples of cultural specificity of legal concepts and models. The research 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_157,1087279,1093230,methods typically used by anthropologists are participant observation involving long 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_158,1093230,1101230,"periods of intensive and focused but essentially unstructured field work. Now, the economic "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_159,1101230,1109090,"approach, it involves application of economic perspective to socio-legal studies. Inspired "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_160,1109090,1115289,by the capability approach of the economists Amartya Sen and by the work of political philosopher 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_161,1115289,1123260,"Nussbaum, the justification and effectiveness of socio-legal norms can be revisited. "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_162,1123260,1128520,The capability approach has been developed in the field of welfare economics and particularly 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_163,1128520,1134510,aims at promoting justice and human development. People’s capabilities might be enhanced 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_164,1134510,1141080,by human rights. The research in socio-legal sphere identifies ways in which capability 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_165,1141080,1148230,"could be operationalized within policy including corporate responsibility, financial services "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_166,1148230,1153259,"and consumer protection. Now, a discussion about the research methods- "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_167,1153259,1160450,This part provides a general survey of the social and philosophical roots of the various 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_168,1160450,1166809,techniques available for data collection and link the ideas involved to a student’s initial 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_169,1166809,1171779,review of the literature on how to develop a viable research question. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_170,1171779,1177179,"Particular attention shall be paid to the contested issues in social science research, "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_171,1177179,1182850,such as the following. What are we trying to achieve when we are engaged in research 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_172,1182850,1188010,activities? Do qualitative and quantitative approaches have equal claims to be considered 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_173,1188010,1194490,empirical? When we decide on which methods to use in collecting the information we need 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_174,1194490,1200031,what assumptions are we making and what do they imply? What philosophical approaches 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_175,1200031,1205480,to these assumptions rest upon? What do the differences between the various 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_176,1205480,1211250,approaches entail for the interpretation of the nature of knowledge and truth? How do 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_177,1211250,1217100,"these differences apply at the ultimate stage, when research findings are used as evidence "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_178,1217100,1223440,to support an argument and the completed text of the thesis must evaluate the validity of 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_179,1223440,1228530,"the initial research design. Finally, having surveyed the dynamic interplay "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_180,1228530,1234279,"between theoretical concepts and empirical data, researcher has to focus upon the importance "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_181,1234279,1240360,of constructing a conceptual framework that will ensure the consistency and integrity 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_182,1240360,1245110,of a research project. Quantitative methods in socio-legal research- 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_183,1245110,1252490,The use of quantitative methods in socio-legal scholarship is ever growing. There is a growing 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_184,1252490,1259440,trend towards empirical legal studies where empirical is defined as large N or quantitative methods. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_185,1259440,1263960,Participant observation - Participant observation 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_186,1263960,1269070,is a type of research that could be regarded as diametrically opposed to the collection 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_187,1269070,1275690,of quantitative data. This relates not only to the methods but to the types of questions 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_188,1275690,1280380,that can be answered. The research design and the subsequent analysis 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_189,1280380,1286880,of data - The researcher shall keep in mind the nature of ethnography and participant 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_190,1286880,1293330,observation and consider how his or her research project may be placed on the scale between 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_191,1293330,1300429,quantitative and ethnographic methodologies. A case study regarding about participant observation 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_192,1300429,1306299,would help and places the researcher in a position to anticipate whether he or she might 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_193,1306299,1311059,encounter any similar practical issues in their research. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_194,1311059,1317059,Interviews - The researcher shall focus upon conducting semi-structured and unstructured 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_195,1317059,1323539,"interviews. As to how to do it tips, it can be drawn from experience in the field. The "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_196,1323539,1328679,researcher shall be mindful of the distinction between individual style and of good or bad 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_197,1328679,1335480,"practice. Analyzing qualitative data, qualitative data pose particular challenges for combining "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_198,1335480,1343010,"creativity and rigour in their analysis. Moreover, given that qualitative in contrast to qualitative "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_199,1343010,1349279,data are often voluminous and unstructured critical reflection of techniques for managing 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_200,1349279,1354950,and interpreting such data is important. The techniques for the analysis of qualitative 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_201,1354950,1361190,"data are not a-theoretical tools, but should be located within theoretical assumptions "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_202,1361190,1367440,about how the social world could be understood and researched. Finally comes the question 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_203,1367440,1372931,of research ethics. Pertinent ethical issues may arise during socio-legal research. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_204,1372931,1380289,"It is important to consider ethical issues, ethical thinking in social studies. This discussion "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_205,1380289,1386730,has made you understand the fundamentals of socio-legal research and the components of 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_206,1386730,1393059,which it is comprised of. It makes you appreciate the utility of socio-legal research. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_207,1393059,1403210,It helps you identify the potential areas of socio-legal research; it introduces 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_208,1403210,1412450,the learner to the socio-legal field. It also helps the students understand the various 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_209,1412450,1420050,"approaches to socio-legal research from the perspective of sociology, anthropology and "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_210,1420050,1428840,"economy and it also introduces the students to various socio-legal research methods. Now, "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_211,1428840,1435070,let us recapitulate what we have learnt so far. 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_212,1435070,1442590,The socio-legal approach may be seen to occupy space between two extremes of a methodological 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_213,1442590,1452200,spectrum. At one end a strict doctrinal approach relies predominantly on self-informed analysis 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_214,1452200,1459720,of legislation and judicial decisions from the superior courts. Approaches at the other 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_215,1459720,1468130,"end such as critical legal studies and economic analysis of law are tuned to the concerns, "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_216,1468130,1475880,theory and informants of external perspectives. While contextual analysis is increasingly 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_217,1475880,1484250,"the norm in legal scholarship, external informants are essential to a socio-legal approach.  "
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_218,1484250,1492020,The socio-legal lens widens to observe operational and every daily legal situations and diverse 
Module_4_Socio_Legal_Research_219,1492020,1498799,"textual sources, disciplinary and culture perspectives are considered. Thank you. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_0,31490,36970,Hi. I am Manvi Tiku. You are watching a module on Research Ethics for Research Methodology 
Module_17_Research_ethics_1,36970,39660,in the course Law. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_2,50660,57140,"So, what is Research Ethics really? Well, to begin with let us understand what do you "
Module_17_Research_ethics_3,57140,63949,mean by a research. A researcher actually speaking lives in every human being.  
Module_17_Research_ethics_4,63949,69851,The thing that differentiates a researcher from another human being is the fact that a researcher 
Module_17_Research_ethics_5,69851,75540,is able to see some or the other problem in the societal dynamics that he is surrounded 
Module_17_Research_ethics_6,75540,79210,"with, problem as in a research problem. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_7,79210,85479,Well societal dynamics always give rise to some or the other social problem because of 
Module_17_Research_ethics_8,85479,94080,conflict of interest which we as law students are all aware of. These societal problems 
Module_17_Research_ethics_9,94080,101020,"are looked at or observed by different researchers or by different people in different ways, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_10,101020,107390,and this kind of observation or the different observations give rise to different set of 
Module_17_Research_ethics_11,107390,110570,research problems in the minds of different researchers. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_12,110570,119450,"Let us take for example, the problem of increasing number of rapes in India may give rise to "
Module_17_Research_ethics_13,119450,125399,an idea in a researcher’s mind that some research is due in the punitive section of 
Module_17_Research_ethics_14,125399,132620,"our criminal law, so he wants to study punishment and to another researcher the same problem "
Module_17_Research_ethics_15,132620,139890,of rapes may give rise to an idea that some research is due in the patriarchal side of 
Module_17_Research_ethics_16,139890,145650,"the feminist studies, so he wants to study feminolo… feminist studies and he wants "
Module_17_Research_ethics_17,145650,147900,to study patriarchy in that. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_18,147900,153170,"Now, what does this tell us? This tells us that the social problems maybe same, they "
Module_17_Research_ethics_19,153170,158620,"may be common because they are coming out from the societal dynamics, but the way that "
Module_17_Research_ethics_20,158620,164050,these social problems are observed and the way that these social problems are perceived 
Module_17_Research_ethics_21,164050,170820,"by different people gives rise to different ideas, different set of ideas in different people.  "
Module_17_Research_ethics_22,170820,175730,What does this tell us? This tells us that it is not just a social problem that is important 
Module_17_Research_ethics_23,175730,181760,"for research, but also the innovation and imagination of of every person comes into "
Module_17_Research_ethics_24,181760,188010,"play when we are talking about legal research. So, a research problem is formulated in a "
Module_17_Research_ethics_25,188010,194480,researcher’s mind. He takes up a research. He is able to get some sponsorship for his 
Module_17_Research_ethics_26,194480,198330,research and what does that heal for him that is a research report. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_27,198330,203870,"So, the research that he conducts or the research idea that was actually conceived by him in "
Module_17_Research_ethics_28,203870,208890,the first place are all tangible things that cannot be seen or touched but the research 
Module_17_Research_ethics_29,208890,214670,"report is something that he is able to produce and we can see it, we can read it and therefore, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_30,214670,222550,we can understand what in what way did that particular researcher perceive a particular social problem. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_31,222550,230450,"Now, why do we need research ethics? Well ethics and morality are some things which "
Module_17_Research_ethics_32,230450,237460,govern each and every aspect of our life. We do not walk out of the doors of our house 
Module_17_Research_ethics_33,237460,243680,"without ethics, well even within the four walls of our house we always follow ethics and morality.  "
Module_17_Research_ethics_34,243680,251550,These are the basic rules that one has to follow being a human being because 
Module_17_Research_ethics_35,251550,256380,"we are not animals, we are higher intellectual animals. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_36,256380,262539,"Now, why do we need ethics in research? Research is something that is to be conducted by every "
Module_17_Research_ethics_37,262539,267760,"individual differently. He has his own set of notions, he has his own set of ideals. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_38,267760,273160,"So, why do we need ethics really? Well that is the catch. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_39,273160,277960,The problem is that even though a research problem may be formulated by different people 
Module_17_Research_ethics_40,277960,284070,"due to their own imagination and due to their innovation, yet the end result that is the "
Module_17_Research_ethics_41,284070,289630,"research report, which is the most important thing may become a common factor. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_42,289630,295570,A research report which has been produced by one person may be used by another person 
Module_17_Research_ethics_43,295570,300370,"saying that ‘it is my research report’. So, now what that other person is doing?  "
Module_17_Research_ethics_44,300370,306479,He is trying to get away with someone else’s work saying that it is his own work. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_45,306479,313379,"That is unethical, he may add some points here and there and just produce a a very "
Module_17_Research_ethics_46,313379,318270,laminated version of that older research and say that it is my own research. That is not 
Module_17_Research_ethics_47,318270,325300,only wrong for the earlier research and the earlier researcher but also it puts in a bad 
Module_17_Research_ethics_48,325300,328490,light on the whole fraternity of researchers. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_49,328490,335550,"So, why do we need research ethics really? Number one – To have a common set of standards. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_50,335550,340150,"What do you mean by common set of standards? Well, the set of standards that would be followed "
Module_17_Research_ethics_51,340150,346460,"by everyone equally, there won’t be any discrepancy, there won’t be any ambiguity "
Module_17_Research_ethics_52,346460,354810,or vagueness. So one researcher cannot say that I am not aware or I I am not in the knowledge 
Module_17_Research_ethics_53,354810,360930,"of what kind of research ethics are there, having a common set or a common standard of "
Module_17_Research_ethics_54,360930,365139,of ethics basically does away with this kind of ambiguity. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_55,365139,372430,"The second thing is, it rules out all kinds of uncertainty. It is for the benefit and "
Module_17_Research_ethics_56,372430,378389,"knowledge of all the people who are coming ahead for research. The third thing is, it "
Module_17_Research_ethics_57,378389,384870,"is a universal thing, research ethics becomes a universal common factor for everyone who "
Module_17_Research_ethics_58,384870,388699,is coming ahead to do research plus they will have prior knowledge. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_59,388699,395650,"So, before a researcher embarks upon a research, any research, he knows what he is getting "
Module_17_Research_ethics_60,395650,401270,"into, because he knows he will have to do an ethical research and he will also know "
Module_17_Research_ethics_61,401270,407439,"what does doing an ethical research mean, so there should be a common set of standards. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_62,407439,418199,Another important factor that makes a research ethics very important is that following ethics 
Module_17_Research_ethics_63,418199,424039,in research or giving or conducting a ethical research basically makes a research socially 
Module_17_Research_ethics_64,424039,429530,"acceptable. Now, why do we need social acceptance if the researcher is doing the research for himself? "
Module_17_Research_ethics_65,429530,436729,"Well, no, the researcher is doing the research for the society. The society is what be the "
Module_17_Research_ethics_66,436729,441719,knowledge bank for the researcher and it is a researcher’s responsibility to give back 
Module_17_Research_ethics_67,441719,445240,to the society what he is gaining from the society. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_68,445240,451500,"So, to gain a social acceptance the researcher needs to do an ethical research.  "
Module_17_Research_ethics_69,451500,457589,"Not only that, before embarking upon the resear… research he needs certain sanctions from certain "
Module_17_Research_ethics_70,457589,462370,"organizations, etcetera, or he needs cer… cer… certain permissions from those people "
Module_17_Research_ethics_71,462370,469650,"from whom he wants to collect his data, etcetera, for all these things and for having an acceptable "
Module_17_Research_ethics_72,469650,476009,"research, the researcher must do an ethical research which will be acceptable to him, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_73,476009,481729,to the future researchers who want to research in the same field as well as to all the actors 
Module_17_Research_ethics_74,481729,484930,and the participant who are a part of the research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_75,484930,491539,The next important factor of having standard research ethics is that it maintains a minimal 
Module_17_Research_ethics_76,491539,498580,"standard of good quality research. Research work in any country, in any field is a very "
Module_17_Research_ethics_77,498580,504400,important component for the development of not only the society but also the knowledge 
Module_17_Research_ethics_78,504400,506430,in that particular field. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_79,506430,512131,"Therefore, having research ethics or following research ethics or conducting a research in "
Module_17_Research_ethics_80,512131,519830,an ethical manner is what will ensure that minimal standards of good quality research 
Module_17_Research_ethics_81,519830,522450,are adhered to. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_82,522450,529350,"Most importantly doing an ethical research sets a good precedent. However, let us take "
Module_17_Research_ethics_83,529350,533750,"an example of a person whose, who may not be doing an ethical research or who has produced "
Module_17_Research_ethics_84,533750,537970,a research report with a lot of plagiarized material. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_85,537970,543920,"Well, what he is simply doing is he is setting a wrong precedent for those researchers whom "
Module_17_Research_ethics_86,543920,550620,he might be guiding tomorrow when he becomes a guiding supervisor or else his plagiarized 
Module_17_Research_ethics_87,550620,556399,material might be used as an inspiration by some other future genuine researcher. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_88,556399,563850,"So, basically unethical research is a chain that cannot be stopped, it is an unending "
Module_17_Research_ethics_89,563850,572560,"vicious circle. For it to stop it is a , it is the responsibility of the researcher himself "
Module_17_Research_ethics_90,572560,579540,to maintain a particular standard so that he is able to set a precedent for the research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_91,579540,585589,"Now, what do you mean by ethical research? Ethical research means following certain ethics "
Module_17_Research_ethics_92,585589,591220,in research. Do we know what these ethics are? No. Is there any law that gives these 
Module_17_Research_ethics_93,591220,598040,ethics? No. Then how do we know what these ethics are? if there are no law and there is 
Module_17_Research_ethics_94,598040,600420,no particular standard that everyone knows. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_95,600420,608740,"Well, the fact is just like in life, research ethics also need to come from the logic of "
Module_17_Research_ethics_96,608740,615639,"the particular researcher as well as from the, from his own genuinity. He needs, it "
Module_17_Research_ethics_97,615639,619480,it needs to emanate from his own genuinity and honesty. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_98,619480,626019,Sincerity in work is the first and foremost thing that a person can do to follow ethics 
Module_17_Research_ethics_99,626019,631920,"in research. Would you, would we be getting any reward for doing an ethical research? "
Module_17_Research_ethics_100,631920,637720,"Well, the answer is no, we do not get a reward for get doing any research. Would we be getting "
Module_17_Research_ethics_101,637720,643529,"punished if we do not do an ethical research? Again unfortunately the answer is no, we would "
Module_17_Research_ethics_102,643529,644620,not be getting punished. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_103,644620,650360,"So, then question number one, how will we ensure that research ethics are followed? "
Module_17_Research_ethics_104,650360,655170,"And question number two, why should we follow research ethics? The answers to these questions "
Module_17_Research_ethics_105,655170,663550,"are, we need to follow research ethics for the sake of saving grace of the whole research "
Module_17_Research_ethics_106,663550,668540,fraternity. It sets a bad precedent to do an eth… an unethical research and the blot 
Module_17_Research_ethics_107,668540,673750,of being an unethical research is something that will never leave the research report 
Module_17_Research_ethics_108,673750,679790,"even if the researcher, the unethical researcher himself wants to make amendments later on. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_109,679790,685690,"Secondly, as far as the question of if there is no law or if there is no punishment then "
Module_17_Research_ethics_110,685690,694190,"how can we ensure that the ethics are followed? It goes like this, in life we have many laws "
Module_17_Research_ethics_111,694190,699860,"that are passed by the parliament, well do these laws, let us take for example, criminal "
Module_17_Research_ethics_112,699860,703250,"laws, do these criminal laws stop crime from happening? "
Module_17_Research_ethics_113,703250,710370,"The answer is no, in the same way having research ethics or having a certain policy for research "
Module_17_Research_ethics_114,710370,716550,ethics does not mean that research ethics will be followed. It only means that we have 
Module_17_Research_ethics_115,716550,722339,a certain standard of to be followed when we are doing research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_116,722339,727750,"Now, what are these code of ethics and there any code of ethics that have been laid down? "
Module_17_Research_ethics_117,727750,732810,"The truth is that every research institution might have their own code of ethics, might "
Module_17_Research_ethics_118,732810,736100,have their own policy and regulations with respect to it. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_119,736100,741709,And for that matter every individual researcher also might be having his own set of ideas 
Module_17_Research_ethics_120,741709,748710,to be followed as in in terms of doing an ethical research. But American Sociological 
Module_17_Research_ethics_121,748710,755660,"Association, in particular, has come up with a set of code of ethics. These, what are these "
Module_17_Research_ethics_122,755660,758199,code of ethics? Let us have a look at them. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_123,758199,762790,First and foremost is professional competence. What is professional competence? Does it only 
Module_17_Research_ethics_124,762790,769010,"mean competence in terms of degree? Like for example, in India we talk about having a master’s "
Module_17_Research_ethics_125,769010,774889,degree to be the minimal to conduct a research. Is it sufficient? Does a master’s degree 
Module_17_Research_ethics_126,774889,779029,ensure that a person is intellectually capable to conduct the research? 
Module_17_Research_ethics_127,779029,785279,The answer may be ‘no’ because even though educational institutions that have research 
Module_17_Research_ethics_128,785279,790620,as part of their curriculum have mandated that a course on Research Methodology has 
Module_17_Research_ethics_129,790620,797410,"to be there and have also mandated a man… a compulsory research work, yet the things "
Module_17_Research_ethics_130,797410,803480,"that a person carries or thing that a person learns in the, during the education may not "
Module_17_Research_ethics_131,803480,807220,be carried forward to his professional time as well. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_132,807220,812520,"So, in terms of this when a researcher proposes a particular research it is not only the duty "
Module_17_Research_ethics_133,812520,818759,but also obligation of the supervisor as well as the research institutes or the sponsoring 
Module_17_Research_ethics_134,818759,825110,institutes to ensure that the person is professionally competent to conduct the research.  
Module_17_Research_ethics_135,825110,832910,It is also desirable that the person himself understands it that what does it mean to be professionally 
Module_17_Research_ethics_136,832910,839680,competent to conduct research and is honest about it and does the research accordingly. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_137,839680,844040,Second thing that has been laid down by the American Sociological Association is integrity. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_138,844040,851740,"Now, the research that is to be conducted has to be honest. The research problems that "
Module_17_Research_ethics_139,851740,857889,have been emanated by the or that have been created by the researcher should be genuine. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_140,857889,863670,And most importantly the work that is being done or that is proposed to be done by the 
Module_17_Research_ethics_141,863670,871339,researcher should be it should be sincere. He should be sincere towards his efforts for the research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_142,871339,877290,The third thing that has been laid down is the professional and scientific responsibility. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_143,877290,884000,"Now, the society as such is the thing that gave the researcher the research problem in "
Module_17_Research_ethics_144,884000,890459,the first place. The society is the one from where the researcher is going to collect his 
Module_17_Research_ethics_145,890459,894290,data and then analyze and interpret his results. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_146,894290,902829,"So, the society is the one to whom the researcher owes a lot. In fact, it is the researcher’s "
Module_17_Research_ethics_147,902829,908819,po… researcher’s responsibility to take care that whatever research he is conducting 
Module_17_Research_ethics_148,908819,915269,"in whichever filed he is conducting a research, he should be able to professionally conduct "
Module_17_Research_ethics_149,915269,920199,the research and follow the technicalities of the research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_150,920199,924350,"For example, there are various tools that are available for data collection.  "
Module_17_Research_ethics_151,924350,930500,There are various techniques for data analysis. There various techniques done for sampling.  
Module_17_Research_ethics_152,930500,937519,There are various techniques at every step of the research and it is the responsibility as well 
Module_17_Research_ethics_153,937519,944209,as it is ethically desirable that the researcher follows all these technicalities in all sincerity. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_154,944209,949990,This is the responsibility that the researcher holds not only towards the society but towards 
Module_17_Research_ethics_155,949990,952470,the research as such. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_156,952470,961610,"The next thing is respect for people’s rights, dignity and diversity. Well the researcher "
Module_17_Research_ethics_157,961610,967709,is bound to collect certain data from the society. This collection of data from the 
Module_17_Research_ethics_158,967709,973820,"society is not the researcher’s right, it is his privilege because he is requesting "
Module_17_Research_ethics_159,973820,980029,the people or he is requesting the society to respond to certain questions and queries 
Module_17_Research_ethics_160,980029,986499,that he might be having so that he he makes conclusions accordingly. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_161,986499,993029,"Now, in all this there might be some times when the researcher may gain access to certain "
Module_17_Research_ethics_162,993029,999769,"confidential information of any person or any organization or institution or a community, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_163,999769,1004959,etcetera and there also might be a situation where that per… that particular confidential 
Module_17_Research_ethics_164,1004959,1012069,information may be very critical or very useful for the research report. In such cases it 
Module_17_Research_ethics_165,1012069,1021560,"is ethically desirable that the researcher, is ethically desirable that the researcher "
Module_17_Research_ethics_166,1021560,1026770,uses the information with the prior permission of the particular person whose confidential 
Module_17_Research_ethics_167,1026770,1027770,information is there. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_168,1027770,1035780,"It is not only ethics that is there, but also social responsibility and a person might not "
Module_17_Research_ethics_169,1035780,1040850,be even aware of is right to privacy but it is again the responsibility and obligation 
Module_17_Research_ethics_170,1040850,1050100,of the researcher to first and foremost take prior permission from from the person concerned 
Module_17_Research_ethics_171,1050100,1054810,whose confidential information he might have gained access to and then and only then use 
Module_17_Research_ethics_172,1054810,1058350,that particular information in the module. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_173,1058350,1063650,"Next thing is social responsibility, as I have already mentioned and emphasized that "
Module_17_Research_ethics_174,1063650,1069809,the researcher owes a responsibility to the society not only because of his research but 
Module_17_Research_ethics_175,1069809,1076370,also because the so… society is what gave him the research problem. The researcher must 
Module_17_Research_ethics_176,1076370,1083410,at all times know that his research is going to pave way for further research in the same 
Module_17_Research_ethics_177,1083410,1090539,"topic or in the same field and also it is going to help, to ameliorate certain problems "
Module_17_Research_ethics_178,1090539,1095900,in the society. After all the researcher came up with the research problem because there 
Module_17_Research_ethics_179,1095900,1099850,were certain problems in the society because of societal dynamics. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_180,1099850,1105409,"So, after understanding these code of ethics that have been laid down, let us understand "
Module_17_Research_ethics_181,1105409,1110770,what are the various checkpoints in research. These checkpoints in research as we call them 
Module_17_Research_ethics_182,1110770,1115750,are the places or are the points during the research when the researcher has to be very 
Module_17_Research_ethics_183,1115750,1122150,"careful of following ethics. So, all these checkpoints have to be kept in mind all the "
Module_17_Research_ethics_184,1122150,1129360,time by the researcher so that he does not he does not digress from the path of ethical research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_185,1129360,1135970,First and foremost is the authorization to research. Authorization to research has to 
Module_17_Research_ethics_186,1135970,1142980,"be had from two main actors, one is the organization or the institution which is sponsoring the "
Module_17_Research_ethics_187,1142980,1149659,"research, second is the participants of the research. Now, the a researcher may have approached "
Module_17_Research_ethics_188,1149659,1155230,"any organization or institution to conduct the research, he may also have approached "
Module_17_Research_ethics_189,1155230,1157909,a particular institution for sponsoring the research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_190,1157909,1164210,In both the cases he has to make sure that he has achieved or he has obtained the requisite 
Module_17_Research_ethics_191,1164210,1170029,authorization to conduct this particular research. Even in cases where the research may be publicly 
Module_17_Research_ethics_192,1170029,1177230,little explosive as in the content of the research or the content that is proposed to 
Module_17_Research_ethics_193,1177230,1183970,"be researched maybe little complicated or conflicting, it care has to be taken on part "
Module_17_Research_ethics_194,1183970,1191550,of the institution that the research has to be given authorization and a green signal 
Module_17_Research_ethics_195,1191550,1196110,and then and only then the researcher can go ahead with the researcher. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_196,1196110,1201279,"Secondly, the researcher has to obtain authorization from the participants in the research.  "
Module_17_Research_ethics_197,1201279,1206650,"Now, participants may be individuals, they may be families, they may be organizations or institutions.  "
Module_17_Research_ethics_198,1206650,1211700,In all these cases the researcher has to make sure that he has obtained the 
Module_17_Research_ethics_199,1211700,1218360,requisite permission to be a part of their lives and observe them or collect data from them etcetera. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_200,1218360,1225190,It is especially very important in cases of participatory observation in which the researcher 
Module_17_Research_ethics_201,1225190,1230350,"is actually living with the people whom he wants to study, so he may not be asking any "
Module_17_Research_ethics_202,1230350,1236590,"questions to them but he will be observing and taking down some notes, according to what he is observing. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_203,1236590,1241809,"So, he might be interfering with their lives and he has to make sure that he tells those "
Module_17_Research_ethics_204,1241809,1247510,people and prior in gives them prior information as to how much interruption will they be having 
Module_17_Research_ethics_205,1247510,1253141,"in their lives. So, all this is very important to gain authorization to research. Another "
Module_17_Research_ethics_206,1253141,1258549,very important aspect of authorization is that every institution or organization to 
Module_17_Research_ethics_207,1258549,1264110,whom you may be approaching for research may have their own principle for conducting research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_208,1264110,1270320,"For example, lots of ministries in the government of India may have their own set of guidelines "
Module_17_Research_ethics_209,1270320,1274529,"for every researcher who may come to them for any questions. So, you have to make sure "
Module_17_Research_ethics_210,1274529,1280429,or the researcher has to make sure that he has comp… complied with all these guidelines 
Module_17_Research_ethics_211,1280429,1285960,and he has to make sure that he gets the requisite pre-authorization to conduct the research 
Module_17_Research_ethics_212,1285960,1288340,before he starts the research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_213,1288340,1294340,"Second thing is that he has to follow appropriate techniques and processes, well this is a very "
Module_17_Research_ethics_214,1294340,1300520,technical point and it does not sound very ethical but the truth is that ethics does 
Module_17_Research_ethics_215,1300520,1306090,"fall out, ethics does come out from the technical things of a research process itself.  "
Module_17_Research_ethics_216,1306090,1314500,"So, if a researcher is not able to follow the techniques that he has read during his education time "
Module_17_Research_ethics_217,1314500,1320610,"etcetera, he may not do it correctly or he may be doing a he may be applying a process "
Module_17_Research_ethics_218,1320610,1324070,correctly but he may be applying it in a wrong place. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_219,1324070,1332049,"So, it is not shameful to go back to the books again and again for checking and referencing "
Module_17_Research_ethics_220,1332049,1336210,and seeing whether what you are doing or what you are conducting the process that you have 
Module_17_Research_ethics_221,1336210,1341850,taken up is correct or not. But it is very shameful if you are doing a research or if 
Module_17_Research_ethics_222,1341850,1347080,you are applying a particular process without actually knowing what you are doing. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_223,1347080,1353169,"Next thing is confidentiality, so as we have already seen that respect of, respect for "
Module_17_Research_ethics_224,1353169,1357659,confidentiality of the people from whom the researcher may be collecting data is very 
Module_17_Research_ethics_225,1357659,1365000,"important and with a, it is not only an ethical duty but an obligation of the researcher towards the society. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_226,1365000,1369230,"So, researcher has to make sure to tell the people from whom he is collecting "
Module_17_Research_ethics_227,1369230,1376250,data and he has to ensure them and that he will not be using any confidential information 
Module_17_Research_ethics_228,1376250,1380190,to whom to which he may gain access without their permission. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_229,1380190,1387560,Next is research responsibility. This research responsibility is not only towards the society 
Module_17_Research_ethics_230,1387560,1393540,but the research field in itself. The researcher has to make sure that whatever research he 
Module_17_Research_ethics_231,1393540,1401169,"does, he is putting it into the knowledge bank of the existing field, so his research "
Module_17_Research_ethics_232,1401169,1408220,is not only going to affect the social dynamics in that particular field but also will steer 
Module_17_Research_ethics_233,1408220,1412760,and affect the future research in that particular field. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_234,1412760,1419350,"Next is respect for people rights, dignity and diversity. Well the researcher has to "
Module_17_Research_ethics_235,1419350,1426210,know that whatever s… social problems he is looking at may be influenced by or may 
Module_17_Research_ethics_236,1426210,1431929,"be affected by lot of people. Now, society is composed of diverse people, there are large "
Module_17_Research_ethics_237,1431929,1434690,number of people having conflicting interest. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_238,1434690,1439580,The researcher has to make sure that during the ongoing process of research as well after 
Module_17_Research_ethics_239,1439580,1446070,"he has come up with his results, he is not producing any more conflict in the existing "
Module_17_Research_ethics_240,1446070,1451460,"conflict of interest. In other words, he has to make sure that he retains and maintains "
Module_17_Research_ethics_241,1451460,1454220,the balance between the conflict of interests. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_242,1454220,1459970,He has to make sure that he respects the diversity of all the people present in the society to 
Module_17_Research_ethics_243,1459970,1466740,whom he has approached for the research or on whom the research has any kind of effect. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_244,1466740,1475070,Well the most important thing that the researcher has has to ensure is that he does not plagiaries 
Module_17_Research_ethics_245,1475070,1477559,anything in the research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_246,1477559,1484730,What is plagiarism? Plagiarism is the act of taking up anyone else’s work and shh… 
Module_17_Research_ethics_247,1484730,1491380,"presenting it or showing it as as your own. Well as serious as that sounds, it is a fact "
Module_17_Research_ethics_248,1491380,1497970,that plagiarism is one of the most common problem that is plaguing the research world today. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_249,1497970,1502880,"What are the causes of plagiarism? First and foremost, it is easy. It is very easy to pick "
Module_17_Research_ethics_250,1502880,1508029,up another person’s work and show it as your own. You do not have to make any efforts 
Module_17_Research_ethics_251,1508029,1511230,and you can just have something to your credit print . 
Module_17_Research_ethics_252,1511230,1516429,"Second thing is laziness. Sometimes researchers are very lazy to make efforts, to make the "
Module_17_Research_ethics_253,1516429,1523360,requisite efforts to produce an original work. Next problem is disinterest. Sometimes a researcher 
Module_17_Research_ethics_254,1523360,1530290,"is not interested in the field that he is chosen for research, that researcher has to "
Module_17_Research_ethics_255,1530290,1534820,make sure that whatever field he has chosen for research is of his interest. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_256,1534820,1540700,"If it is of his, if it is not of his interest or if it has been imposed upon him by the "
Module_17_Research_ethics_257,1540700,1546380,"supervisor or the institution etcetera, he may not put in the requisite amount of efforts "
Module_17_Research_ethics_258,1546380,1552840,or he may do a half-hearted job. In such scenarios the easiest way of doing work is to plagiarise 
Module_17_Research_ethics_259,1552840,1555090,someone else’s work. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_260,1555090,1561080,The next problem is some other professional commitments. Well the researcher also hav… 
Module_17_Research_ethics_261,1561080,1565790,may have some other professional commitments like teaching or some other research works 
Module_17_Research_ethics_262,1565790,1571440,"etcetera, or he may be employed in some other place, in such scenarios the research gets "
Module_17_Research_ethics_263,1571440,1578539,affected because again the researcher wants to have a easy way out and for the same he 
Module_17_Research_ethics_264,1578539,1582080,can use someone else’s work and show it as his own. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_265,1582080,1590019,"Another problem is, another cause of plagiarism is that it saves time. So, often, very often "
Module_17_Research_ethics_266,1590019,1595830,amateur researchers or student researchers or unguided freelance researchers just do 
Module_17_Research_ethics_267,1595830,1600789,a research and they try to plagiarise someone else’s work because it is going to save 
Module_17_Research_ethics_268,1600789,1606740,"their time and within lesser time they are going to have a research report in their name, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_269,1606740,1611539,whether that research report is original or not or whether that research report is going 
Module_17_Research_ethics_270,1611539,1615960,to be of any use to them or to the society or not is none of their concerns.  
Module_17_Research_ethics_271,1615960,1621830,They are only concerned with having a credit to a particular research report. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_272,1621830,1625940,Another problem that researchers often face is the pressure of competitions.  
Module_17_Research_ethics_273,1625940,1633649,"Well, in today’s age where the research field itself is growing into a very varied field with lots "
Module_17_Research_ethics_274,1633649,1639330,"of opportunities and scope, it is very difficult to for a researcher to concentrate and do "
Module_17_Research_ethics_275,1639330,1645929,a particular research without having much money in the hands and doing the research ethically.  
Module_17_Research_ethics_276,1645929,1650840,"For this purpose what the researcher does is, he takes five researches or five research "
Module_17_Research_ethics_277,1650840,1657090,works in hand and he can plagiarise material from one research work to another research 
Module_17_Research_ethics_278,1657090,1663010,"work, this saves his his time and as I said he gets more than one research report to his "
Module_17_Research_ethics_279,1663010,1671050,"credit, but that is not an ethical thing to do and that again, it increases the instances of plagiarism. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_280,1671050,1680220,Last and most important reason for plagiarism to happen is that there are hardly any checks. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_281,1680220,1686360,"In a country like India where technology is increasingly being used by researchers, even "
Module_17_Research_ethics_282,1686360,1692100,"amateur and student researchers to make their research easy, plagiarism has also become "
Module_17_Research_ethics_283,1692100,1700240,easy and because plagiarism has become easy it was but a natural consequence that some 
Module_17_Research_ethics_284,1700240,1707260,or the other check or balance should have been institutionalized but that has not happened. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_285,1707260,1714429,"Let us look further whether some institutional checks have been conducted or not till date, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_286,1714429,1719580,but before that let us look at what are the types of plagiarism. First and foremost and 
Module_17_Research_ethics_287,1719580,1724289,the most commonest kind is the direct plagiarism. Direct plagiarism means where a person copies 
Module_17_Research_ethics_288,1724289,1731010,a whole chunk of some someone else’s work and shows it as his own. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_289,1731010,1737200,"So, a work may be an idea or a word may be the complete consequence of an idea that is "
Module_17_Research_ethics_290,1737200,1742940,"the research report or a article etcetera. So, where a person uses someone else’s literary "
Module_17_Research_ethics_291,1742940,1748990,"work whether it is in a book or in an article or in a research report etcetera, where that "
Module_17_Research_ethics_292,1748990,1755580,particular material written by someone else or authored by someone else is used and produced 
Module_17_Research_ethics_293,1755580,1758940,as your own it is called as direct plagiarism. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_294,1758940,1764519,"Another form of plagiarism is indirect plagiarism, wherein the idea of another person is copied. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_295,1764519,1770019,"Now, one would think that two people can think the same thing that is true. However, the "
Module_17_Research_ethics_296,1770019,1776880,way of presenting an idea and the way of communicating that idea or the way of converting the idea 
Module_17_Research_ethics_297,1776880,1780799,into a particular literary work differs. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_298,1780799,1785910,"However, sometimes it has it has been seen that a researcher very cleverly change some "
Module_17_Research_ethics_299,1785910,1791120,"words here and there, change some certain patterns here and there and produced the idea "
Module_17_Research_ethics_300,1791120,1797980,"or the a particular research report of someone else in his own name, saying that it was my "
Module_17_Research_ethics_301,1797980,1801320,idea. That kind of plagiarism is called as indirect plagiarism. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_302,1801320,1807640,"Third and a very common kind of plagiarism is patch writing, patch writing is where a "
Module_17_Research_ethics_303,1807640,1813639,researcher or let’s say an unethical researcher or a plagiariser uses a whole chunk of anyone 
Module_17_Research_ethics_304,1813639,1819510,else’s literary work and puts it in his own research. It may be intentional or it 
Module_17_Research_ethics_305,1819510,1825409,may be unintentional that is all up to the researcher but in direct plagiarism the researcher 
Module_17_Research_ethics_306,1825409,1832029,"may have used little pieces of information here and there or little pieces of sentences, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_307,1832029,1837559,"etcetera, here and there from other person’s research. In patch writing a whole paragraph "
Module_17_Research_ethics_308,1837559,1843780,"or a whole page etcetera, is completely picked up from the original place and put in the "
Module_17_Research_ethics_309,1843780,1850679,plagiarised material that is the research work of an unethical researcher. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_310,1850679,1857789,Another type of plagiarism that happens and it is very rampant is unintended plagiarism. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_311,1857789,1863720,Unintended plagiarism as the name suggests is not the intention of the plagiariser.  
Module_17_Research_ethics_312,1863720,1869340,"In that case, the plagiariser or the unethical researcher may have forgotten to cite the "
Module_17_Research_ethics_313,1869340,1873970,reference or cite the place from which he may have taken a particular information or 
Module_17_Research_ethics_314,1873970,1881090,taken a particular literary work. In this case the researcher may not have intended 
Module_17_Research_ethics_315,1881090,1884290,but his carelessness is what causes the plagiarism. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_316,1884290,1890400,"So, that is also not forgivable because where we are talking about professionalism, research "
Module_17_Research_ethics_317,1890400,1899150,"is a professionalism. So, in cases of professionalism such kind of carelessness is not neither desirable nor acceptable. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_318,1899150,1909600,"Next is self-plagiarism, self-plagiarism means where a person publishes or uses his own published "
Module_17_Research_ethics_319,1909600,1915380,"material in his own research work. So, a person may have published something earlier, an article "
Module_17_Research_ethics_320,1915380,1922159,"or a research work etcetera, and in subsequent research work he uses his own previously published "
Module_17_Research_ethics_321,1922159,1927299,"article. That is that may sound like it is not plagiarism because after all, that person "
Module_17_Research_ethics_322,1927299,1933710,"is using his own intellectual product, but the fact is because it has already been published "
Module_17_Research_ethics_323,1933710,1937669,he has to either cite it or not use it completely. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_324,1937669,1943710,"He can take an idea from it, he can get inspired from it, after all it his own work, he cannot "
Module_17_Research_ethics_325,1943710,1950800,"plagiarise the whole thing. So, what is the thing that has caused plagiarism the most? "
Module_17_Research_ethics_326,1950800,1958250,"The answer unfortunately is technology. Technology has been playing well, it has been like a "
Module_17_Research_ethics_327,1958250,1963550,stepbrother to research because on one hand it has helped to ameliorate the problems of 
Module_17_Research_ethics_328,1963550,1970740,researchers in a big way. Technology has helped research in a very major way but on the other 
Module_17_Research_ethics_329,1970740,1975860,hand technology has been shaking hands with plagiarism also. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_330,1975860,1981630,"On the one hand it has made plagiarism easy, on the other hand it has given researchers "
Module_17_Research_ethics_331,1981630,1989370,the right or the access to a lot of open access content. There is a lot of easy web sharing 
Module_17_Research_ethics_332,1989370,1996929,"which helps the researchers to share their content easily via emails or whatever, in "
Module_17_Research_ethics_333,1996929,2002950,"in whatever way, the technology is helping the researchers to not only share their content "
Module_17_Research_ethics_334,2002950,2007059,but also access a lot of scholarly articles. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_335,2007059,2014909,"For example, a lot of research work is available online today. It is a very common thing to "
Module_17_Research_ethics_336,2014909,2020470,"not refer to books first, but to go to the internet and see what is available and see "
Module_17_Research_ethics_337,2020470,2024399,what is the primary explanation of a particular thing. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_338,2024399,2030679,"In such a scenario plagiarism has also been made easy because a lot of scholarly articles, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_339,2030679,2035539,a lot of articles resear… written by research scholars which may or may not be within the 
Module_17_Research_ethics_340,2035539,2043700,"copyright time period, are available online in an open access fashion. So, this has made "
Module_17_Research_ethics_341,2043700,2050950,plagiarism very easy. Plagiarism being easy has become a very tough thing for the researchers 
Module_17_Research_ethics_342,2050950,2055230,"to handle, especially those researchers who have been in the research field for a long "
Module_17_Research_ethics_343,2055230,2059000,time but are now supervising amateur researchers. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_344,2059000,2067659,"So, is there any protection against plagiarism or is it all just hot air? The answer is ‘yes’, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_345,2067659,2073700,"even though plagiarism is an unethical way of doing research, yet it is a legal wrong "
Module_17_Research_ethics_346,2073700,2080639,"when it comes to The Copyright Act of nineteen fifty seven. In India, this act protects all "
Module_17_Research_ethics_347,2080639,2086169,"kinds of literary works, so a research report or an article or anything that is published "
Module_17_Research_ethics_348,2086169,2091570,in the way of literature is given protection under The Copyright Act. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_349,2091570,2098060,"Under The Copyright Act, a person who has who or who is the original author of any piece "
Module_17_Research_ethics_350,2098060,2103940,of writing has the exclusive right to use that particular piece of writing whether that 
Module_17_Research_ethics_351,2103940,2110510,"is a research report or a thesis, a dissertation or any small paper or an article even.  "
Module_17_Research_ethics_352,2110510,2115810,He has the exclusive right to use that piece of writing for monetary benefits or he also 
Module_17_Research_ethics_353,2115810,2123380,"has the exclusive right to assign any license to a person, to another person to use that particular thing. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_354,2123380,2129730,"So, in other words, this Copyright Act gives the exclusive right to this person to not "
Module_17_Research_ethics_355,2129730,2136369,"only use his particular, his piece of writing for monetary benefits but also he can exclude "
Module_17_Research_ethics_356,2136369,2141390,the other people and if he does not want to exclude the other people he can give them 
Module_17_Research_ethics_357,2141390,2142819,license to use it. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_358,2142819,2148690,"Without their permission if a person uses anyone’s original piece of writing, he is "
Module_17_Research_ethics_359,2148690,2152600,liable to be punished under The Copyright Act. The remedies that are given under The 
Module_17_Research_ethics_360,2152600,2158790,"Copyright Act are compensation to the person whose copyright has been infringed, injunction "
Module_17_Research_ethics_361,2158790,2164089,"by the court which the court says, puts a stop on all the manufacturer of publishing "
Module_17_Research_ethics_362,2164089,2169220,or all the publishing on the things that the plagiarizer might have done and the third 
Module_17_Research_ethics_363,2169220,2172030,thing imprisonment and penalty. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_364,2172030,2178970,In all these ways The Copyright Act protects against plagiarism. Well this is all about 
Module_17_Research_ethics_365,2178970,2185500,"plagiarism, but how do we uphold research ethics? All said and done, it is the self-discipline "
Module_17_Research_ethics_366,2185500,2191540,of the person himself by way of which he can uphold research ethics. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_367,2191540,2195190,"As we have seen certain checkpoints during research, which the researcher has to take "
Module_17_Research_ethics_368,2195190,2201849,care that he is not violating any research ethics at that particular point. It is after 
Module_17_Research_ethics_369,2201849,2210350,all the self discipline of the researcher himself which can keep him on the track for 
Module_17_Research_ethics_370,2210350,2211970,an ethical research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_371,2211970,2216840,"Self-discipline is not only in terms of doing an ethical research when it comes to plagiarism, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_372,2216840,2223470,"but also in terms of following all the technicalities of the research process, right from the time "
Module_17_Research_ethics_373,2223470,2229670,of the research problem formulation to the time of the last word when he is writing for 
Module_17_Research_ethics_374,2229670,2231970,the research report. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_375,2231970,2238280,"Second thing is that there should be checks by the supervisor, so the supervisor or any "
Module_17_Research_ethics_376,2238280,2243290,institution under which the researcher may be doing his research or any sponsoring institution 
Module_17_Research_ethics_377,2243290,2248829,also for that matter should keep some kind of checks. These checks may be in the form 
Module_17_Research_ethics_378,2248829,2255770,"of policy guidelines or as these days some softwares, some software companies are coming "
Module_17_Research_ethics_379,2255770,2258609,up with anti-plagiarism softwares. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_380,2258609,2265130,"One example of such a software is Turn It In, which basically makes sure or ensures "
Module_17_Research_ethics_381,2265130,2270430,that the person who is submitting a research report or any piece of writing has not plagiarised 
Module_17_Research_ethics_382,2270430,2278440,from any open access content or any book that have that are within the copyright term. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_383,2278440,2284460,"Next is institutional checks, Turn It In is one example of such checks and it is also "
Module_17_Research_ethics_384,2284460,2290220,desirable that the institution lays down from the very beginning and takes an undertaking 
Module_17_Research_ethics_385,2290220,2294900,from the researcher that he or she will conduct the research in an ethical manner following 
Module_17_Research_ethics_386,2294900,2300910,"all the rules that have been laid down and following the code of ethics that is acceptable, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_387,2300910,2303470,that is an acceptable standard. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_388,2303470,2308069,"Next thing is referencing, which is a very important and crucial thing especially in "
Module_17_Research_ethics_389,2308069,2316060,legal research. Referencing means citing or giving the complete name of the a source from 
Module_17_Research_ethics_390,2316060,2320609,"a particular piece of writing has been taken. So, for example, a researcher while writing "
Module_17_Research_ethics_391,2320609,2327870,"a research report may like to quote a particular author, if not a huge chunk of it maybe two "
Module_17_Research_ethics_392,2327870,2335000,or three sentences from that author and he feels that converting it into his own words 
Module_17_Research_ethics_393,2335000,2338990,may result in losing the essence of what the other author has said. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_394,2338990,2344050,"In such a case he may use the quote, he may quote that particular author but he should "
Module_17_Research_ethics_395,2344050,2348940,"ensure that he has referenced that author, he has cited that author in the prescribed "
Module_17_Research_ethics_396,2348940,2354630,manner. This prescribed manner is there are various institutions which have come up with 
Module_17_Research_ethics_397,2354630,2362770,"their own set of citation rules. Some, popular ones are Oscola, MLA Handbook, the Harvard "
Module_17_Research_ethics_398,2362770,2366579,"Style Bluebook, APA , etcetera. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_399,2366579,2372240,"Last and but but never the least is using the technology ethically. So, technology may "
Module_17_Research_ethics_400,2372240,2377680,be a friend to plagiarism but it is a greater friend to researcher and it is only up to 
Module_17_Research_ethics_401,2377680,2383690,the researcher to use the technology in an ethical or an unethical way. At the end of 
Module_17_Research_ethics_402,2383690,2391580,"the day the researcher is himself, his own master and is himself is his own student when "
Module_17_Research_ethics_403,2391580,2395280,it comes to using the technology as a research tool. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_404,2395280,2403060,"So, it has to be ensured by the researcher that he is not going aboard or he is not going "
Module_17_Research_ethics_405,2403060,2411900,"overboard with using the technology for the sake of research. So, summing up what we have "
Module_17_Research_ethics_406,2411900,2417120,"learnt in this module. First and foremost, we saw that the research is not only a value "
Module_17_Research_ethics_407,2417120,2421210,addition to the society but also to the field of research. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_408,2421210,2426960,"So, research problems may be coming out from the society itself because of the social dynamics "
Module_17_Research_ethics_409,2426960,2432140,there might be some soc… social problems which a researcher observes and he is able 
Module_17_Research_ethics_410,2432140,2435020,to formulate a research problem out of them. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_411,2435020,2441819,Research is a value addition to the society in the sense because researcher does the research 
Module_17_Research_ethics_412,2441819,2448280,or he he proposes to do the research with the thought that he will be able to help in 
Module_17_Research_ethics_413,2448280,2453430,"ameliorating that particular problem from the society. So, the researcher has to take "
Module_17_Research_ethics_414,2453430,2459030,care and he has to know that he is a responsible person for this research not only for the 
Module_17_Research_ethics_415,2459030,2463160,society but also for the future research in the same field. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_416,2463160,2468540,"Next thing is that ethicals research sets a particular standard, it sets a precedent, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_417,2468540,2474680,so it is desirable that a researcher follows ethics in his research right from the step 
Module_17_Research_ethics_418,2474680,2479560,one to the last step of his research. It will not only make him feel good but will also 
Module_17_Research_ethics_419,2479560,2485319,"set a good precedent for all the future researches, and for all the researches that he might be "
Module_17_Research_ethics_420,2485319,2488140,supervising in the future. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_421,2488140,2493270,For this purpose there might not be any law but institutions can come up with their own 
Module_17_Research_ethics_422,2493270,2498130,"policy guidelines. In fact, an association as we have already seen American Sociological "
Module_17_Research_ethics_423,2498130,2506079,"Association has come up with certain points, with certain pointers that give the code of ethics. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_424,2506079,2511520,"Next is how can be, how can res… ethical research be done? One has to follow the code "
Module_17_Research_ethics_425,2511520,2517460,"of ethics that we discussed. Second thing, one has to take care at certain points during "
Module_17_Research_ethics_426,2517460,2523760,"the research, at those points during the research when the researcher may digress to an unethical "
Module_17_Research_ethics_427,2523760,2529040,"part, he has to make sure that he comes back and he does only an ethical research. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_428,2529040,2534760,"He has to promise to himself, he has to commit to the research as well as show himself that "
Module_17_Research_ethics_429,2534760,2542840,"this is a professional demand and a professional moral, ethical obligation that he does an ethical research. "
Module_17_Research_ethics_430,2542840,2548160,"Next we learnt about plagiarism, we learnt how plagiarism is done and what are the causes, "
Module_17_Research_ethics_431,2548160,2553190,why is has it become very rampant? And we learnt the various kinds of plagiarism. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_432,2553190,2557930,We also saw that there are some plagiarism whi... which may not look like plagiarism like unintended 
Module_17_Research_ethics_433,2557930,2563650,"or self-plagiarism, but in fact, it is plagiarism and it should, the researcher should make "
Module_17_Research_ethics_434,2563650,2567420,all efforts to avoid it and prevent it. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_435,2567420,2572300,"Technology has been a friend to plagiarism as we have already seen, plagiarism has been "
Module_17_Research_ethics_436,2572300,2580130,"made mighty easy with technology. Like, for example, in earlier times it was very difficult "
Module_17_Research_ethics_437,2580130,2586059,"to copy a whole book because there were no computers, so one had to type everything because "
Module_17_Research_ethics_438,2586059,2591980,"there were no photocopy machines, that during that time plagiarism even though it was conducted "
Module_17_Research_ethics_439,2591980,2593930,but it required a lot of efforts. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_440,2593930,2601460,"But today plagiarism has become as easy as research itself, so it is it is in the desire "
Module_17_Research_ethics_441,2601460,2608670,"or it it is in the interest of the ethical research that the research, sorry, that the "
Module_17_Research_ethics_442,2608670,2614510,"researcher makes a commitment to himself that he will not use technology unethically, he "
Module_17_Research_ethics_443,2614510,2619480,"will not use the technology for plagiarism, but he will the use the technology as a friend "
Module_17_Research_ethics_444,2619480,2620680,to the researcher. 
Module_17_Research_ethics_445,2620680,2626030,We also learnt certain protection that is given under The Copyright Act against plagiarism 
Module_17_Research_ethics_446,2626030,2633660,and we learnt some tips to uphold research ethics which vary from the institution as 
Module_17_Research_ethics_447,2633660,2636000,well as to the researcher himself. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_0,31519,38450,"I am Doctor Nuzhat Parveen Khan, Associate Professor, Faculty of Law, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.  "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_1,38450,46239,Today the topic of our discussion is “Jurimetrics- The Science of Law.” 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_2,46239,53000,The learning objective of this particular subject Jurimetrics is Jurimetrics is the 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_3,53000,60850,"study of science of law. It is made up of two words- Juris which means law, E-metrics "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_4,60850,68070,which means eco metrics. Jurimetrics is a step towards seeking new alternatives in the 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_5,68070,73329,field of legal enquiry and is not to be treated as a science. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_6,73329,82119,"Jurimetrics involves a stricty, strictly empirical approach to the law and examines a wide range "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_7,82119,90670,of scientific and legal topics that are interrelated. The term Jurimetrics was coined by Lee Loevinger 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_8,90670,97649,in the year nineteen forty nine who introduced this word into legal vocabulary later on in 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_9,97649,105880,"the late fifties and this wo,... Jurimetrics signifies scientific investigation of legal problem. "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_10,105880,114729,Further as the use of computers in law practice began to revolutionize the areas of legal 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_11,114729,123490,"research in the evidence analysis, data management, the Jurimetrics gained further momentum in "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_12,123490,132420,"legal researches.wo... In the recent years, an attempt to predict judicial behavior has also "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_13,132420,141700,taken a mechanical term for which the term Jurimetrics become more appropriate. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_14,141700,149470,The Jurimetrics takes the form of different kind of investigations into legal phenomena 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_15,149470,159780,"by using symbolic logic, behavioral models and mechanical aids. The theme of Jurimetrics "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_16,159780,167370,in the olden days was not to eliminate the reasons or philosophy from jurisprudence or 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_17,167370,175660,to find out substitute for necessity values which are an intrinsic part of lawmaking. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_18,175660,188040,"Further, the Jurimetrics signifies the scientific investigation especially by using electronic "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_19,188040,196420,methodologies and by using symbolic logics. We as a law student know that law can develop 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_20,196420,204480,only by continuously drawing new values and solutions from the li… life of the community 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_21,204480,211550,and this is achieved partly by the development of new laws and partly by the standards and 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_22,211550,218920,principles which are implied in particular branches of law. And we also know that it 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_23,218920,225980,is a legislature which is entrusted with the work of making of the law and it is further 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_24,225980,233820,the lawyers and the judges who are scientifically and intrinsically involved in the study of law. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_25,233820,241030,"So, how can we say or how far the work or, of a judge, task of a judge in developing "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_26,241030,246680,the law can be described as scientific? What is the theory? The theory which they follow 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_27,246680,252430,is theory of logical plenitude. What is this logical plenitude theory which the judges 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_28,252430,262910,apply while they are developing a judgment? The logical plenitude theory means that the 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_29,262910,270930,law is not a mere collection of detailed rules but an organic body of principles with inherent 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_30,270930,276340,scope of growth and flexibility to adapt to new circumstances. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_31,276340,285941,"A rational system for the exercise of authority of human being. Further, the Doctrine of Logical "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_32,285941,293960,Plenitude is to be used in a way to make it a narrowing force because if a case is decided 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_33,293960,302870,purely by logical deductions from the actual rules then we will crush its growth. The growth 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_34,302870,310880,of the law will be crushed if the logical plenitude theory is applied in strict sense. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_35,310880,318719,"Further, leading works on Jurisprudence, one of the work Jurimetrics Symposium contain "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_36,318719,326449,an introduction to the new discipline of science of law and also a number of the types of works

Module_14_Jurimetrics_38,336610,346180,"applications to the law, it is being concluded by various studies that the most perfect machine "

Module_14_Jurimetrics_40,354999,363180,on a public matter that is the legal regulation of social relations. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_41,363180,369830,The scientific development in the codification of law is also led to the danger of “machine-made 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_42,369830,377710,justice”. By allowing a proportion of legal inquiries to be conducted by machines rather 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_43,377710,384419,than by individual judges may cause judges and lawyers to avoid the responsibility for 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_44,384419,391139,"their hard legal decisions, but to resort to ready-made answers based on computers, "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_45,391139,397210,which definitely is not a good sign. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_46,397210,404650,"However, the vast range and huge accumulation of material relevant to the legal process "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_47,404650,413311,"seemed to demand some kind of legal some kind of mechanical and mathematical approach, if "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_48,413311,420539,"only towards information storages and retrieval, which means just to sort out the material, "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_49,420539,425849,"we can use mechanical tools, but with regard to reasoning the decision, it is necessary "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_50,425849,431110,that there should be some legal reasoning and legal reasoning is a process through which 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_51,431110,434789,data is interpreted as high-level concepts. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_52,434789,441139,Then further legal reasoning takes intensive factual interpretations and the drawing of 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_53,441139,449960,"conclusions through heuristic computations. Further, it is thought that artificial intelligence "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_54,449960,456699,"tools, some form of computational models, which are appearing nowadays as legal expert "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_55,456699,463330,system shortly we can call them L E X . These L E X can be devised for the analysis of legal 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_56,463330,471689,problems within defined domain where possible to provide basic legal advice derived from

Module_14_Jurimetrics_58,475099,483820,Legal expert system is a relatively young industry and it is a very authoritative definition

Module_14_Jurimetrics_64,512599,521219,They are built with the assistance of human experts. L E X operates in specific problem areas. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_65,521219,527279,L E X also help in augmenting rather than supplementing humans.  
Module_14_Jurimetrics_66,527279,533330,They are not intended for use by laymen. That means those who are experts in the legal skills 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_67,533330,540220,can use these legal expert systems and the L E X are transparent also because they explain 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_68,540220,546490,the lines of reasoning. They are flexible also.

Module_14_Jurimetrics_98,739920,744180,is Jurimetrics in judicial research. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_99,744180,751670,Jurimetrics substantially involves the use of quantitative methods in judicial research. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_100,751670,756650,Quantitative methods are essentially aids in descriptions. They help to bring out in 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_101,756650,762220,"details the regularities in the data which are, which the researcher has collected.  "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_102,762220,771990,Further they are suited to the handling of large quantities of data and wide range of variables. The bulk 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_103,771990,778920,of the data and the complexity of the variables involved may make it extremely difficult to 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_104,778920,786790,handle the data manually and in that circumstance the Jurimetrics and the computer aid becomes very helpful. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_105,786790,794260,With the help of computers it becomes easy and it becomes desirable to use computers 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_106,794260,802540,because it has opened up unprecedented opportunities to look beyond the fragmented terms of unconnected 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_107,802540,810920,knowledge. Quantitative methods are the ways of summarizing the features and relationship in data. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_108,810920,817860,"Further, the statistical measures based on the theory of probability go beyond the mere "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_109,817860,827680,quantitative data and use devices to bring out the association between variables emerging out of data. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_110,827680,835420,Then Jurimetrics though is not a substitute for basic elements of judicial reasoning. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_111,835420,844260,"However, it is helping to put a series of questions that are capable of investigation. "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_112,844260,852490,"It seeks not sudden relationship or universal laws, but the slow accretion of tested information. "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_113,852490,859030,As we have seen in the previous text that though the judicial attitude and judicial 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_114,859030,864900,"motives are very important in any decision making and in any judicial de,... process, "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_115,864900,871600,but computers are getting helpful and all these mechanical tools are becoming aids to 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_116,871600,880410,help the judicial process. But despite that Jurimetrics is encountering certain problems 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_117,880410,886630,which can be encountered with the while the use of computers is made. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_118,886630,893460,"Sometimes, it, you know we can divide these approaches into group approach and computer "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_119,893460,898820,"prediction. Now, it is difficult to predict the behavior of individual, but that of mass "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_120,898820,905830,of people is easier. It is also difficult to obtain adequate information about the inner 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_121,905830,912670,working of a group. Also available information with the help of these machines can be misleading. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_122,912670,920070,"When using scientific models which are simplified abstractions of fixed phenomena, the corrections "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_123,920070,923350,that have to be made are also fixed. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_124,923350,928830,"That means if errors are fixed, the corrections are also fixed. Where, however, the phenomena "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_125,928830,934480,fluctuates as with human beings. The social phenomena generally are fluctuating and it 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_126,934480,941430,is impossible to know what corrections need to be made and for what purpose these models 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_127,941430,948190,"becomes useless. Further, the computer prediction so far as there is a consistency in decision "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_128,948190,956000,and attitude the prediction of judicial opinions by computers become possible through fact studies.  
Module_14_Jurimetrics_129,956000,962020,Fact studies means the acceptance of a fact by an appellate court rested on identifiable 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_130,962020,968870,conditions surrounding the way in which it was presented to the trial court. If the accepted 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_131,968870,976690,"facts are combined in certain ways, the decision will go in one way. Then attitude studies. "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_132,976690,983920,Attitude is nowadays is capable of being scaled by means of scalogram. A person who reacts 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_133,983920,990440,positively to a weak stimulus will definitely react similarly to another weaker stimulus. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_134,990440,996610,"If the line of cases can be made to scale in this way, a set of values can be shown "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_135,996610,1003051,to be shared by members of that court thereby making the future behavior predictable.  
Module_14_Jurimetrics_136,1003051,1009360,"That means once a person's attitude is one type of, in one situation, the chances are it is "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_137,1009360,1015380,"going on to be the similar or same in another situation. However, any attempt at prediction "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_138,1015380,1021920,seem to fail because this is a very technical and typical type of situation the behavior 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_139,1021920,1027720,will remain same because the personal element just cannot be eliminated from judicial decisions 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_140,1027720,1031730,and everything depends on how facts are viewed and stated. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_141,1031730,1038410,The same set of facts can be stated in different combinations and at different levels of generality. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_142,1038410,1044850,No mechanical aid can predict such combination or levels as is likely to be chosen.  
Module_14_Jurimetrics_143,1044850,1053870,Different ratios can be extracted from a decision depending on whether the later court wishes to see resemblance 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_144,1053870,1060230,or differences. Then predictability of judicial decisions also depends upon the consistency 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_145,1060230,1067910,"of the judges, their attitude, their behavior, their values and people’s attitude, people, "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_146,1067910,1072650,"judges are also people, people's attitude changes with age and experience. "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_147,1072650,1077850,"So con,... however, con,... computer predictions always remain static. Computer prediction "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_148,1077850,1083170,"can only work on the basis of reported decisions, the majority of which are essentially those "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_149,1083170,1090430,of lower court and they are unreported and the judges in their decision-making at times 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_150,1090430,1093980,refer to even those unreported judgments also. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_151,1093980,1101059,A computer analysis indicating a judge's decision can distract the judges from the judicial 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_152,1101059,1109880,function because the judicial functions includes many other type of factors which we will study 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_153,1109880,1116270,"in the later part of this lecture. Now, if we talk of the use of Jurimetrics in the Indian "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_154,1116270,1121500,"legal system, first of all, let us understand the judiciary, Indian Judiciary. We have three "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_155,1121500,1126510,"wing, important wings of the government and judiciary is one of the, these three wings "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_156,1126510,1127510,of the state. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_157,1127510,1132600,The structure of the judiciary in our country is pyramidical in nature and the Supreme Court 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_158,1132600,1138760,of India is the highest judicial forum and final court of appeal. Article one thirty 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_159,1138760,1146400,"seven of the Supreme Court, of the Constitution gives the power to the Supreme Court to review "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_160,1146400,1154360,"its own judgments. Further, article one twenty nine gives power to punish anyone for the "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_161,1154360,1159960,"contempt of Court of India, any Court of India including Supreme Court. "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_162,1159960,1167800,"Then, now let's talk about the judicial behavior of the judges of the Supreme Court of India "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_163,1167800,1174570,"and then the use of Jurimetrics. The judge’s philosophy, which is reflected in the judicial "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_164,1174570,1181010,"pronouncement. Just, Benjamin Cardozo in his classical work, Nature of Judicial Process "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_165,1181010,1188840,mentioned various factors which influence judicial functioning and the behavior is one of them. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_166,1188840,1194910,It is always a social and political background of the judges which is relevant in explaining 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_167,1194910,1202020,in explaining the decision-making behavior. There are dynamics theories of judicial process. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_168,1202020,1208520,The picture of the judges as a policy oriented decision-maker who drives his premises both 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_169,1208520,1214490,from within and outside the courtroom and whose functions are exceeding the mechanical 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_170,1214490,1219750,work by applying settled rules of law to clear fact situation. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_171,1219750,1226220,"Theories does not specify the precise nature of the relationship between judge’s background, "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_172,1226220,1231580,"his experience and his judicial work, which definitely makes an important part while a "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_173,1231580,1237120,judge gives a decision. The judicial decision cannot be explained solely in terms of social 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_174,1237120,1243690,background itself. There is a philosophy and psychology of the judges which is more helpful 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_175,1243690,1251309,whi… while a judge pronounce or gives a judgment. The Constitutional law in fact changes 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_176,1251309,1257140,according to the philosophical current in the minds of the judges. The social views 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_177,1257140,1263230,and legal philosophy of the judge are often powerful forces both in shaping of the law 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_178,1263230,1266520,and administration of the judiciary. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_179,1266520,1274610,The subjectivity of an individual judge plays the most important role in the deciding of 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_180,1274610,1281270,cases because the inherent morality which is embedded in a judge's subconscious mind 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_181,1281270,1289490,"gives the law the dynamic character. Every judge has his or her own, his or her own perception "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_182,1289490,1298960,of what the law is and the law functions and that is what is undertaking to be implemented. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_183,1298960,1306000,"Now, psychological motives and influences are not adhered when one assumes a role of "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_184,1306000,1312470,a judge. That is a case with other opinion of the individuals. The judicial opinion represented 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_185,1312470,1317750,"in, in a measure of personal impulse of the judge in relation to the situation before "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_186,1317750,1324640,him and these impulses are determined by judge’s lifelong series of previous experience.  
Module_14_Jurimetrics_187,1324640,1331130,"That means somehow the background and whatever the judge, judge have percept, perceived before "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_188,1331130,1336270,being the judge of the Supreme Court or the High Courts is definitely going on to reflect 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_189,1336270,1338850,while the judge is giving a judgment. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_190,1338850,1346860,Then human factors and the environment is definitely an important aspect in the judicial decisions. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_191,1346860,1351450,The personality of a judge plays an important part in the process of their 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_192,1351450,1358040,adjudication on particular cases and has to be taken into account as an innumerable part 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_193,1358040,1365180,of the case. As a child the judge who was born into a human community that is already 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_194,1365180,1371950,experienced and classified and almost endless number of situations and the behaviors which 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_195,1371950,1375170,are appropriate to each situation. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_196,1375170,1382690,"The, guidelines derived from all this experience and all these situations are imparted "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_197,1382690,1391310,"to the child as he develops and matures. When as an adult the judge is faced with a situation, "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_198,1391310,1397720,the preconscious and the subconscious screening and the typing of the situation and rules 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_199,1397720,1404300,of behavior occur and this affects the person's particular personality and behavior.  
Module_14_Jurimetrics_200,1404300,1411700,"Because judges are also men from diversified backgrounds, while they are interpreting the Constitution, "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_201,1411700,1419330,they are inferring out of their experience and their ideal of the social order. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_202,1419330,1425270,"We have, I think, being the law students we have noticed various judgments, various judges, "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_203,1425270,1431150,"their behaviors, their judgments and their powerfulness, their landmarkness such as, "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_204,1431150,1439030,"all of us talk of Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Bhagwati, their philosophies, their parameters "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_205,1439030,1444300,"of creating with regard to PILs , the judgement with regard to judicial independence. "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_206,1444300,1450980,They are very famous just because they have given the interpretation in such a way that 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_207,1450980,1456750,"peop,... it it it become important and integral part of our Constitutional system.  "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_208,1456750,1462050,"Similarly, Justice Kuldeep Singh and Justice Verma are also remembered. Justice Verma very famous "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_209,1462050,1468280,for giving sexual harassment guidelines which shows his sensitivity towards the women and 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_210,1468280,1473700,the weaker sections of the society. Justice Khanna gave ADM Jabalpur judgment.  
Module_14_Jurimetrics_211,1473700,1483640,"Despite he have to leave his race for the Chief Justice post, but he he gave a very big and long judgment, "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_212,1483640,1486760,a humane judgment in ADM Jabalpur case. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_213,1486760,1493860,"Marken… Markandey Katju for his different approach, Gyan Sudha Mishra giving a judgment "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_214,1493860,1500179,"in Aruna Shaunbaug which is about passive euthanasia, Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan, Indra "

Module_14_Jurimetrics_216,1505650,1512450,"a sin, though it may not be socially acceptable. There are, we also have Justice Ganguly and  228 00:25:12,450 -->  00:25:20,120 some other judges whose behavior have become subject matter of discussion due to some bad reasons also. "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_217,1520120,1525640,The judge’s participation in the decision-making process gets subjected to both the formal 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_218,1525640,1531980,"and informal rules and practices adopted in the bench assignment activity, which is a "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_219,1531980,1538370,complex phenomenon. The social attitude and values preferences of judges are reflected 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_220,1538370,1544990,in the opinions they write and the vote they cast for or against a particular judgement. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_221,1544990,1551549,One of the prerequisites for studying such differences among the judges is that the individualistic 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_222,1551549,1558030,"behavior of each judge must reveal certain recurrent pattern, uniformities and consistencies "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_223,1558030,1564740,"over a period of time. Only if the regularities are observable, the variables sufficient to "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_224,1564740,1572679,explain the observed regularities can be identified. Supreme Court of India and its judges have 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_225,1572679,1576940,limited success in it because of certain reasons. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_226,1576940,1582030,One of the reason is the short tenure of the judges which leads to rapid turnover in the 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_227,1582030,1588400,court making it just difficult to observe their respective behavior over a reasonable 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_228,1588400,1595860,"period of time. However, we see the examples of recent examples of minority and majority "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_229,1595860,1602290,judgement that reflects the behavior and the background of the judges. The frequent use 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_230,1602290,1608380,of small panels which consist of two or three judges to dispose of bulk of the work of the 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_231,1608380,1615190,court ruling out any possibility of all or majority of the judgment to partic… participate 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_232,1615190,1620480,jointly and simultaneously on the decision-making panels. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_233,1620480,1626590,"Number three, the quantum and character of overt dissent in the court has been such that "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_234,1626590,1634910,"it does not easily lend itself to behavioral analytical tools. Now, finally to conclude "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_235,1634910,1641140,"this lecture, we can say that in order to analyze judgements you need some insight into "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_236,1641140,1647130,the decision-making process of a judge. Since very little has been written by the judges 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_237,1647130,1654290,themselves about the practicalities of the judgeship in modern times.There arise today 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_238,1654290,1659760,an emphasis on the logic of discovery and the drawing of an analogy between the task 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_239,1659760,1663190,of the judge and that of a natural scientist. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_240,1663190,1669170,"Jurimetrics, the application of modern logic and computer technique to legal problems may "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_241,1669170,1676350,"be useful in the analysis of facts, in the identification of ambiguities, in the syntax "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_242,1676350,1682860,and perhaps in the prediction and formulation of judicial decisions. Jurimetrics does not 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_243,1682860,1690170,"offer any social answers. It is concerned with only investigating, their structure and "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_244,1690170,1696830,dimensions of all experi… experience that of relevant to such law. Jurimetrics further 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_245,1696830,1702300,"have two dimensions, information technology and computer advanced technology and second "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_246,1702300,1708380,part mental physical and social background of the judges and its impact on him while 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_247,1708380,1710120,deciding the cases. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_248,1710120,1718210,"So, finally we can say until a time technology reaches such a high where artificial intelligence "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_249,1718210,1725040,"would be able to analyze with certainty, the mechanism by which a judge decides a case "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_250,1725040,1730669,"and inquiry into the subjectivity of the judge’s discretion, it would rest with the subjective "
Module_14_Jurimetrics_251,1730669,1738350,analysis of fellow humans who are subconsciously governed by their sets of social and mental background. 
Module_14_Jurimetrics_252,1738350,1741310,The Jurimetrics will be a true science only then. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_0,359,1359,Hello everyone. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_1,1359,6620,"Welcome back to a whole new module of Research Methodology under the MOOCs program, which "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_2,6620,9910,you are mu… must be finding very beneficial by now. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_3,9910,12419,As we have completed very many modules. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_4,12419,17050,"Let’s start with the technique that is called as Projective Technique, and if you remember "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_5,17050,19600,I am Doctor Ritu Sharma from National Law University. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_6,19600,24580,"And, today I will be dealing with a new topic called Projective Technique. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_7,24580,28750,"And we’ll be understanding the meaning of project, the Projective Technique. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_8,28750,33680,We’ll go back to historical development of this technique and try to understand how 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_9,33680,37360,to design and structure this technique called projective technique. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_10,37360,43300,"We will also be talking about the types of projective techniques, where we will be dealing "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_11,43300,47100,with the advantage and disadvantage of this research method. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_12,47100,53020,"So, when we talk about projective technique, let’s start it, how it was used for the "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_13,53020,54020,first time? 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_14,54020,57940,"So, projective technique is the method initially used by psychologist. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_15,57940,63230,"It made up of, it is made up of two words, if you can see one is project and the other "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_16,63230,64230,one is technique. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_17,64230,66010,What is projection? 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_18,66010,74840,"A defense mechanism with which the ego products, protects itself from anxiety by externalizing unpleasant feelings. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_19,74840,77740,What is projective technique? 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_20,77740,84450,"The use of vague, ambiguous, unstructured stimulus objects or situation, in which subject "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_21,84450,90200,"projects his or her personality, attitude, opinions, self-com… conception to give the "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_22,90200,92380,situation some structure. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_23,92380,98850,It is used in Clinical psychology and Consumer Marketing and Advertising Research. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_24,98850,102330,Generally known as motivation research. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_25,102330,108549,"It uncovers feelings, beliefs, attitudes and motivations, which may many consumers find "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_26,108549,109820,difficult to articulate. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_27,109820,116450,"It discovers the person’s characteristic, modes of perceiving his or her world and how "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_28,116450,117480,to believe in it. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_29,117480,123180,It enters the private word of the subject to uncover the ee… inner perspective in 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_30,123180,125329,a way they feel comfortable with. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_31,125329,131770,"So, in other words we can say that projective technique means projecting one’s internal "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_32,131770,138569,"state that is attitude, emotions, motives, values and needs to external object. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_33,138569,144080,"When a person is questioned to measure the extent of his knowledge of subject matter, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_34,144080,147690,he gets little opportunity to project himself. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_35,147690,152380,"On the other hand, if we ask him to write about himself, he gets better opportunity "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_36,152380,156770,"to express himself, to project his personality in writing. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_37,156770,163110,"According to Kerlinger, a basic principle of projective technique is that the more unstructured "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_38,163110,170600,"and ambiguous a stimulus is, the more a subject can and will project his emotions, attitude and values. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_39,170600,177320,A highly structured sim… stimulus as in personality questionnaire leaves very little 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_40,177320,179770,choice of one’s own interpretation. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_41,179770,185040,"When an individual is questioned and the question is disguised, he is more likely to give a "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_42,185040,188800,true answer – Consciously or unconsciously. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_43,188800,192569,"In explaining the project technique, Ram Ahuja gives a beautiful example. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_44,192569,198670,"He says, “If a Doctor is asked, why did he purchased an expensive car? "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_45,198670,204209,"He will say, “Because it has a comfortable ride, because it gives a better mileage, because "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_46,204209,207630,it does not require much maintenance and so on.” 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_47,207630,213200,"But, if we ask him, “Why did his brother, who is equally rich bi… bought a big car?” "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_48,213200,216080,"He would say, “Because he is a status seeker.” "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_49,216080,220510,A person tells the truth when he is given a mask. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_50,220510,226830,"This indirect method of discovering an individual’s attitude, motivations, and defensive way of "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_51,226830,229780,responding is called as projective technique. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_52,229780,236190,"Projective technique is best used for assessing individual’s personality, attributes or "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_53,236190,238690,eliciting his inner feeling. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_54,238690,245150,"Since, projective method avoids direct questions about the topic of interest it is regarded "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_55,245150,248550,as indirect data gathering procedure. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_56,248550,255340,"According to Zikmund, projective technique is an indirect mean of questioning that enables "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_57,255340,263979,"the respondent to project beliefs and feelings onto a third party, to an inanimate object, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_58,263979,266800,or into a task situation. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_59,266800,273449,These tests consist of standardized procedures for eliciting responses to ambiguous stimuli 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_60,273449,275080,interview like exchange. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_61,275080,281150,The tests provides vaguely defined or unstructured task. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_62,281150,288279,"Such task allow the subject to see, say, or do what they wish to with minimal guidance "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_63,288279,291650,or restrictions from the interviewer. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_64,291650,297199,Projective techniques got the name from the assumption that the subject projects his or 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_65,297199,304069,her unconscious thought and feelings onto the screen provided by the unstructured task. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_66,304069,311050,"Because of the emphasis on the unconscious, most projective techniques are identified "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_67,311050,314360,with psychoanalytical theory. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_68,314360,319509,Projective Technique is a way of transcending communication bury… barriers. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_69,319509,321830,People do not share their inner most feeling. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_70,321830,327550,"They are unaware of their underlying motives, aspirations, values and attitudes. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_71,327550,335849,They fear being considered irrational or stupid and are reluctant to admit to certain type of behavior. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_72,335849,343449,They tend to offer answers that are socially acceptable and stereotypical in a interview situation. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_73,343449,349379,"Instead of questioning them directly, talking about a third party or an object, the subject "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_74,349379,355270,projects their cov… covert feelings to a third party or object. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_75,355270,362020,"It helps in understanding the behavior and personality of low literate consumers, children, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_76,362020,366009,"adolescents, impulsive, compulsive or addictive buyers. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_77,366009,370740,"People in the face of catastrophe like hurricane Katrina, earthquake, war, etcetera. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_78,370740,375999,It also helps in understanding the behavior of gay and lesbian consumers. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_79,375999,386659,"So, what is the histo… history behind the development of this projective technique? "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_80,386659,391520,The origin and early development of projective test are closely inter-with with development within psychoanalysis. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_81,391520,395930,Indeed Freud’s theory of dreams and technique of dream interpretation may be considered 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_82,395930,401849,the most important single source of the dominant ideas in the area. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_83,401849,409080,"At about this time Jung’s Studies in Word-association appeared, which also has been heavily influential "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_84,409080,411939,in the development of the projective testing. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_85,411939,416379,"The Rorschach’s test, best known for all projective tests, was developed by a student "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_86,416379,423629,of Jung’s and was undown… undoubtedly influence by psychoanalytical theory and practice. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_87,423629,429159,The term projective technique came to be associated with these instruments primarily as a result 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_88,429159,434309,of the writings of Henry Murray and Frank during the nineteen thirties. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_89,434309,441389,"However, the relationship between the concept of projection and these instrument is anything but precise.  "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_90,441389,447910,"Indeed, one can say that projection as the term is conventionally used within psychoanalysis "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_91,447910,453189,"today, is seldom directly involved in projective technique responses. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_92,453189,459499,"In the two decades following World War One, there was a very rapid development and application "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_93,459499,466069,of aptitude and ability tests as exemplified by the Stanford Binet and various group tests. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_94,466069,472439,Following World War Two there were comparable developments in the area of personality testing 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_95,472439,476179,with projective technique receiving the most prominent attention. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_96,476179,482039,"It was during this period that the society for projective technique, made up of persons "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_97,482039,485499,"involved in the study and application of these devices, was formed. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_98,485499,492080,"At the same time the journal of projective technique, a journal that contains only papers "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_99,492080,494839,"dealing with these instruments, appeared. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_100,494839,499889,"In addition, an extraordinarily large number of articles and books concerning these technique "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_101,499889,501900,have been published. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_102,501900,506610,"Even for a single instrument, such as the Rorschach test, a total bibliography would "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_103,506610,509990,now include more than a thousand items. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_104,509990,517199,"Moreover, within modern graduate programs in psychology, the inclusive of one or more "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_105,517199,520200,courses dealing with projective technique has become standard. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_106,520200,527720,"So, the development and application of these instruments have been associated closely with clinical activities. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_107,527720,533730,"For the most part individual drawn to these devices have been working in clinical settings, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_108,533730,538879,often with disturbed persons and typically under circumstances where individual subjects 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_109,538879,544649,could be subjected to a relatively intensive and detailed study. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_110,544649,550720,"Moreover, the techniques have been considered most attractive and useful by persons who "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_111,550720,556800,are heavily influenced by psychoanalytical theory or some variety of holistic theory. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_112,556800,563640,"Seldom has a heavy emphasis upon the objectivity, per… precision and psychometric elegance "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_113,563640,568250,been characteristic of work with these devices. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_114,568250,571370,The characteristics of projective techniques. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_115,571370,576389,Kidder has given some important characteristics of projective technique. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_116,576389,582410,"The different stimuli like inkblot test, picture test, doll test, etcetera. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_117,582410,584970,Capable of arousing different kinds of reaction. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_118,584970,588529,There are no right or wrong answers. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_119,588529,593350,The respondent is not faced with a set of limited alternatives. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_120,593350,599000,The emphasis is on respondent’s perception and the meaning given to the subject matter. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_121,599000,603649,The individual has not to talk directly about himself or herself. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_122,603649,609060,"So, the purpose of the test is not indicated to the individual. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_123,609060,615889,The responses are interpreted as indicating the individuals own view of the word. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_124,615889,621149,The individuals response are not taken at face value that is with the meaning that this 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_125,621149,627710,subject presumably would expect them to have have but are interpreted in terms of some 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_126,627710,635300,pre-established psychological conceptuals of what responses to the specific test situation mean. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_127,635300,640310,"The interpretation considers responses not in isolation, but is respect to patterns. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_128,640310,648560,The tester attempts to arrive at a psychological coherent picture of the individual by delivering 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_129,648560,655250,the full meaning of any particular response from the total record of the person’s replies. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_130,655250,661750,"So, given these general remarks concerning the nature and origin of projective techniques, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_131,661750,671120,it may be helpful to provide concrete identification of the intu… instruments by means of representative illustration. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_132,671120,675519,"So, for doing that we will be classifying the projective techniques. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_133,675519,681939,"There are many different approaches to classify these tests, but the most useful approach "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_134,681939,687100,focuses on the nature of the response evoked from the subject. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_135,687100,693160,"On this basis, projective technique may be grouped broadly into the following categories "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_136,693160,699779,"first, association, second, construction, third, completion, fourth, choice or ordering "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_137,699779,702699,"and finally, expression. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_138,702699,709660,"First, association – Included association techniques are those instruments that tend "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_139,709660,714470,to minimize ideation and emphasize immediacy of response. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_140,714470,720899,The subject is instructed not to reflect but rather to respond to the stimulus with the 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_141,720899,725569,"first word, image or percept that occurs to him. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_142,725569,729240,In this there is one concept called word association. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_143,729240,735819,"An early and well known example is the word association technique, which involves the "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_144,735819,742529,"oral presentation of a series of disconnected word, one at a time, to which the subject "

Module_29_Projective_Technique_146,747129,753610,"Typically, both the subjects association and reaction time to each word are recorded. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_147,753610,760509,Word association test can take many forms as there is no single excepted list of words. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_148,760509,766889,"Simply put, when using this type of test, the assessor would read a list of words, asking "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_149,766889,773459,the participant to write down the very first that comes to mind after each. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_150,773459,780860,The object is to bypass defense mechanism that are at play and get to the unconscious 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_151,780860,784959,before these defense have a chance to work. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_152,784959,791589,"As you might guess, there are some words that are common on such a test like mother, father, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_153,791589,794769,"and sex, being at the top of this list. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_154,794769,801279,"There is research on word association test, but since there is no standard form, the efficacy "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_155,801279,803860,of such has not been determined. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_156,803860,811180,"Like many of the projective technique, it may be that this assertion provides some quality "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_157,811180,816980,information that in the very least can inspire further investigation. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_158,816980,822790,"The latter is similar to Jung’s, which contains many words of psychoanalytic significance, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_159,822790,827079,particularly with regard to psychosexual conflict. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_160,827079,833010,"Depending upon the particular purpose of the user, scoring and interpretation may involve "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_161,833010,840420,"an analysis of the count, content of the association, in terms of their relevance to a particular "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_162,840420,847649,"motive or conflict as such as dominance or aggression, or in judgement concern the degree "

Module_29_Projective_Technique_164,853319,859399,The subject’s response may be compared with the typical performance of psychiatric and 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_165,859399,862540,normal group on the same list of word. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_166,862540,870339,"In addition of their content, association are often analyzed in terms of proportion "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_167,870339,876129,"of common responses, temporal deviation and associative disturbances, such as repeating "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_168,876129,881070,the stimulus word or giving extremely remote association. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_169,881070,884089,Rorschach and other inkblot techniques. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_170,884089,890700,"By far the most popular projective technique, in terms of frequency of clinical and research "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_171,890700,896809,"appliance is the Rorschach technique, which consist of ten symmetrical inkblots. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_172,896809,901499,The Rorschach is the most commonly used projective technique. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_173,901499,908439,"The test consist of ten white cards and blots of ink on them in there, in either black or "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_174,908439,911329,"black and red, or multi-colored. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_175,911329,917249,These inkblots were originally random in design and these have been maintained although much 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_176,917249,920510,research has gone into each card. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_177,920510,926899,"Typically the cards are presented individually and in a set of order, with instructions to "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_178,926899,933939,"the subject that the, that he report what the figure resembles or suggest to him. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_179,933939,939689,Responses to each card are recorded verbatim and reaction times are noted. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_180,939689,946129,Following which an inquiry is conducted wherein the subject identify the characteristics of 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_181,946129,951550,"the stimuli, which determine or contribute to his associations. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_182,951550,957660,"If you ever, if you have ever looked to this sky and saw some images in the cloud, then "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_183,957660,961540,you can appreciate the idea behind the Rorschach test. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_184,961540,968399,"If the cards have no specific shape, just like the clouds, the shapes we see are projected "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_185,968399,969480,from our unconsciousness. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_186,969480,978809,"In other words, it is not uncommon for children to see bunny rabbits, kitty cats, and monsters in the cloud. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_187,978809,983949,These images represent their needs for life and love as well as their underlying fears 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_188,983949,986040,about death and aggression. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_189,986040,992880,The research that has taken place with the Rorschach card has produced a standardized 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_190,992880,997439,"protocol, eliminating the biggest criticism of projective test. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_191,997439,1005579,"They have also helped us developed standardized interpretation, which allows for more congruency between evaluators.  "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_192,1005579,1012339,"The standardization allows us to compare the results of one person’s Rorschach to anothers, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_193,1012339,1019430,"and while it is the most accepted projective technique, it continues to lag far behind, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_194,1019430,1022379,more commonly used assessment devices. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_195,1022379,1030949,"There are variety of scoring system in use, the most popular of which are by Beck and Klopfer. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_196,1030949,1036780,"The, those aspects of responses which are usually scored are location, the relative "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_197,1036780,1042699,size of the blot area incorporated including the use of white space. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_198,1042699,1047779,"Determinants, the use of colour and shading in comparison with the forms or shape of the "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_199,1047779,1054860,"blot, and the presents of movement either human, animal or inanimate in the response. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_200,1054860,1063830,"Also noted are the accuracy of form of perception, the incidents of popularity and original responses "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_201,1063830,1066750,and the total number of responses. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_202,1066750,1072910,"The content of responses is also classified at least in terms of human, animals, anatomical, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_203,1072910,1080149,"nature, and abstract classes, although some scoring conventions are quite elaborated in "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_204,1080149,1081790,"the, in this respect. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_205,1081790,1088120,Various scores representing the number of responses falling into each category are usually 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_206,1088120,1095650,"further transformed into ratios of score, which are considered essential for interpretation. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_207,1095650,1102360,Most system of interpretation of these quantitative scores and ratios prescribed inferences to 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_208,1102360,1110750,be drawn regarding the more general organization of personality rather than specific motives or conflict. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_209,1110750,1117789,It is usually emphasized that the interpreter must consider the entire profile of scores 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_210,1117789,1121250,rather than isolated scores. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_211,1121250,1127830,Modification of this technique have involved developing new stimuli and move objective 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_212,1127830,1133470,"scores procedures, as well as alternative forms and group version of the test. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_213,1133470,1140270,"Perhaps the most interesting modification is the Holtzman Inkblot Technique, which introduced "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_214,1140270,1145690,desirable psychometric properties to basic Rorschach approach. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_215,1145690,1147480,Second one is the construction. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_216,1147480,1153330,Construction technique requires the subject to go beyond simple association to a stimulus 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_217,1153330,1160490,"and to create or construct a more elaborate product, which is typically a complete art "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_218,1160490,1163860,"form, such as a story or a picture. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_219,1163860,1171230,"The Thematic Apperception Test was developed by Henry Murray, a student of psychoanalytical thought. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_220,1171230,1179740,The thematic test consist of numerous cards and with black and white and grayscale pictures. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_221,1179740,1182250,These pictures were chosen for reason. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_222,1182250,1189440,"First, they are ambiguous to some extents and portray emotions and thoughts without specifying details. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_223,1189440,1195970,"An example would be a silhouette of a man looking of into the distance, while there "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_224,1195970,1201669,"is a obvious emotional and intellectual activity, the details are not revealed. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_225,1201669,1209200,"The Thematic Appreciation Test, that is also known as TAT , consist of cards containing "

Module_29_Projective_Technique_229,1229270,1236710,"So, analyze, analysis of TAT stories, whi… which are usually recorded verbatim, is far "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_230,1236710,1242390,"from standardized, although a number of general scoring system have been proposed. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_231,1242390,1248480,Most of this system focus on the content of behavior and experiences described in the 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_232,1248480,1254909,"story, although they differ considerably in the unit of analysis employed at the degree "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_233,1254909,1256470,of inference required. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_234,1256470,1263710,"As used clinically, interpretation typically has not rested upon a set of objective scores "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_235,1263710,1265600,for specific variables. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_236,1265600,1272840,"The base, the basic assumption of most scheme is one of a psychological isomorphy between "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_237,1272840,1278559,disposition attributes to the part of the major character in this story and those that 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_238,1278559,1280750,exist in the storyteller. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_239,1280750,1282559,The Blacky Picture test. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_240,1282559,1289370,"Closely related to TAT is the Blacky Pictures test, which is intended to investigate eleven "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_241,1289370,1298300,"specific psychoanalytical variables, including oral eroticism, oedipal intensity, and castration anxiety. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_242,1298300,1304260,The test consist of twelve cartoons concerned with the experience in a life of a dog named 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_243,1304260,1308980,"Blacky, including his relationship with Mama, Papa, Tippy, a sibling. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_244,1308980,1315539,As its central feature the procedure involves story constructing in response to the picture 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_245,1315539,1322580,but adds indication of pre… preferences and a series of direct questions for each picture.  
Module_29_Projective_Technique_246,1322580,1328570,"While ad… administration is highly standardized, scoring and interpretation are not standardized. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_247,1328570,1330540,Then third technique is called the completion. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_248,1330540,1337610,"Completion technique present some type of incomplete products, with the requirement "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_249,1337610,1343840,that the subject completes it in any manner he wishes to and the restriction that the 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_250,1343840,1349149,completion meets certain standards of good form or rationality. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_251,1349149,1355130,"Best known of these devices are the sentence-completion test, which are widely used by both clinically "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_252,1355130,1356840,and personality investigators. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_253,1356840,1363650,"Typically such a device consist of thirty to one hundred brief sentences stems, which "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_254,1363650,1369580,the subject is instructed to complete with the first word that comes to his mind. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_255,1369580,1375130,In some cases the instruction to the subject emphasize that the completion should reveal 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_256,1375130,1376350,his or her own feelings. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_257,1376350,1383970,The type of scoring employed and the customary inferences divide from this techniques suggest 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_258,1383970,1387380,its closed knit relationship with the TAT. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_259,1387380,1394720,"The technique is considered most efficient in assessing the content of personality, that "

Module_29_Projective_Technique_261,1400210,1406429,instrument as the Rorschach or TAT. Other example of completion tests are story completion 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_262,1406429,1409260,and argument completion tests. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_263,1409260,1415419,"Many test of this type have been developed, some of which investigate particular personality features. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_264,1415419,1418480,Others are designed specifically for children or adolescents. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_265,1418480,1428289,Subjects are asked to complete sentences with such oo… open ended beginnings as ‘I wish

Module_29_Projective_Technique_269,1442720,1448070,"Still other types of projective techniques have been developed, including some that ask "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_270,1448070,1452330,the subject to create drawing or complete a story. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_271,1452330,1455279,Lindzey call this as completion technique. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_272,1455279,1461130,The respondents are given some incomplete stories or sentences for completion.

Module_29_Projective_Technique_279,1498870,1506500,but sentence completion questions tend to be more extensive than answers to word association test. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_280,1506500,1514070,"This assessment can take num… numerous form, but the main idea behind it is completion "

Module_29_Projective_Technique_288,1550870,1557470,"The incomplete sentence such as also work well with children, some say even better, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_289,1557470,1564860,"because they tend to be more honest and less wise as to, as to the purpose of the assessment. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_290,1564860,1569929,Then third one is the Choice of ordering Technique. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_291,1569929,1576700,"Choice of ordering technique requires the respondents choose from a number of alternatives, "

Module_29_Projective_Technique_297,1604950,1612639,"This test was devised by Szondi, a Hungarian psychiatrist in nineteen thirty’s, and made "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_298,1612639,1618970,popular in the United States through the efforts of Susan Deri. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_299,1618970,1623070,The test material consist of forty eight photographs of individuals drawn from eight psychiatric 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_300,1623070,1629510,diagnostic categories or rather complex and lengthy administration procedure elicits from 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_301,1629510,1633350,the subject expressions of preference for the different photographs. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_302,1633350,1640480,That test is based on the assumptions that a person can be described in terms of eight

Module_29_Projective_Technique_304,1647090,1651990,indicating the degree or of strength of or tension in each. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_305,1651990,1658620,"Although the test enjoyed considerable popularity in clinical settings during the nineteen fifty’s, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_306,1658620,1662799,more recently there has been less evidence of application.

Module_29_Projective_Technique_308,1668149,1673500,"and a highly objective scoring system, the theoretical rationale of the test has been "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_309,1673500,1678220,appeared to be anything but compelling to most American psychologists. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_310,1678220,1682919,Attempts at empirical verification of the test seem to be overwhelming negative.

Module_29_Projective_Technique_321,1732360,1736260,for the use of the descriptive statements as well. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_322,1736260,1741560,This test is unique in its consideration for interpretation of only those responses that 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_323,1741560,1743169,are relatively rare in occurrence. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_324,1743169,1750290,Rare responses patterns from a subject provide a basis for estimating certain tendencies 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_325,1750290,1757970,such as hypochondria for avoidance of people and for distinguishing normal from abnormal subjects. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_326,1757970,1763380,"The existence of a highly objective scoring procedure, coupled with the demonstration "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_327,1763380,1769350,"of certain distinct differences in the performance of normal and disturbed subjects, identifies "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_328,1769350,1775039,this instrument possessing object and nominating property that are not encountered anywhere 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_329,1775039,1778220,else in the domain of projective techniques. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_330,1778220,1784450,"On the other hand, the data collected are sharply delimited, and the process of demonstrating "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_331,1784450,1789700,that the test sensitive useful has only begun. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_332,1789700,1793200,"Expressive methods, and last one is the expressive method. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_333,1793200,1797990,Expressive method differs from construction technique in that they place as much emphasis 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_334,1797990,1803460,upon the matt… manner and style in which product is created as upon the product itself. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_335,1803460,1809120,"They are often considered to be therapeutic as well as diagnostic devices, since the subject "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_336,1809120,1814990,is presumed to relieve his difficulties in the process of revealing them. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_337,1814990,1821690,"Play is the most popular among the expressive instruments, originating in play therapy these "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_338,1821690,1827679,"methods have been adapted for the diagnosis and measurement of personality, primarily in children. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_339,1827679,1834029,All the approaches present the subject with an array of toys which he is encouraged to 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_340,1834029,1836179,use in some manner. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_341,1836179,1840950,Among the objects frequently selected are dolls representing adults and children of 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_342,1840950,1845100,both the sexes and various age age levels. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_343,1845100,1851190,"Typically, the examiner is responsible for recording as much of these subject’s behaviour "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_344,1851190,1859690,"as possible, including his choice and arrangement of toys, accompanying comments, and exper… expressive behaviour. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_345,1859690,1866690,This projective method is used extensively both in theory and data gathering for interviews. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_346,1866690,1872230,"For example, the interviewer studying the sibling rivalry can set a scene containing "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_347,1872230,1878929,"a mother doll who is breast-feeding a baby doll, with another doll of the same gender "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_348,1878929,1884799,"as the responding looking on, as the respondent looking on. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_349,1884799,1889470,"The investigator then ask the child, “What he or she thinks?” "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_350,1889470,1895190,The child doll will say and do when he or she encounters the mother baby. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_351,1895190,1899809,Dolls have also been used in extensively in studying the prejudices. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_352,1899809,1906029,"The researcher, for example, might produce a doll representing a maid servant and a doll "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_353,1906029,1911500,"representing a princess, a doll representing a white person or a doll representing a black "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_354,1911500,1919530,"person, ask the child which one he or she would rather play with and which is smarter. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_355,1919530,1923740,"The researcher, without asking the question, can simply observe which doll child chooses "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_356,1923740,1924740,to play with. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_357,1924740,1931460,The similar methods in expressive techniques are role play and drawing and painting. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_358,1931460,1938669,"The, there is also a variety of drawings and painting techniques that have been used in personality assessment. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_359,1938669,1945460,"So, except for the work carried out by Sears and his associates, which has focused on measures "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_360,1945460,1951559,"of aggression and dependency, little has been done with this technique in the way standardize "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_361,1951559,1956549,and specification of just how the process of interpretation shall take place. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_362,1956549,1961259,"In most instances, it is assumed that the examiner will recognise important motives "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_363,1961259,1964280,and conflicts when he sees them. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_364,1964280,1970840,The limitations of projective technique method is that the information derived about subjects 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_365,1970840,1974230,personality characteristics is indirectly or inferred. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_366,1974230,1979419,Against this the techniques personality questionnaire gives more direct information. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_367,1979419,1984049,The difference between the projective test and personality questionnaire is that the 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_368,1984049,1990730,"items in the personality questionnaire are structured and they being free from any ambiguity, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_369,1990730,1996200,"they convey the same sense to whosever take, whosoever takes the test. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_370,1996200,2000980,The difference in the response made by the different subject is no way determined by 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_371,2000980,2007000,difference in their perception and understanding of the given items. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_372,2007000,2013250,"On the other hand, in projective test, the stimulus is unstructured, ambiguous and unclear. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_373,2013250,2018950,"The responses in the projective test tell nothing directly about the subject, they constitute "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_374,2018950,2022799,a description of the stimuli. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_375,2022799,2025840,Project test lack the objectivity of the personality test. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_376,2025840,2030669,"Since, the subject does not think that his personality is being assessed, it does not "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_377,2030669,2034559,motivate him to give a fake response. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_378,2034559,2039820,"And the as we have discussed the limitations of this method, there are few advantage also "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_379,2039820,2040940,of these method. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_380,2040940,2047179,The projective test assumption that the individual responses to ambiguous stimulus presented 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_381,2047179,2052210,to him reflects significant and relatively enduring personality attributes. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_382,2052210,2058670,The advantage of this technique is that it is relatively disguised and therefore non-reactive 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_383,2058670,2063250,compared with more obtrusive self report measures. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_384,2063250,2069720,The respondents cannot in infer with answer will produce the desired impressions. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_385,2069720,2078170,"In spite of their best intention, the subjects maybe unable to describe their feelings and "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_386,2078170,2084270,attributes as accuracy as they may be discerned in the projective test situation. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_387,2084270,2091120,"For example, when the students are asked, “What are the qualities of a good and bad teacher?” "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_388,2091120,2092960,They may not freely point out these qualities. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_389,2092960,2099390,"But, when they are show me some pictures, situations of teachers, and are asked to point "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_390,2099390,2103690,"out what is the, what the teacher should do or should not do? "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_391,2103690,2107320,"They will feel more, more free to give their choices. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_392,2107320,2113830,Projective test produce more extensive information than a questionnaire or even an interview. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_393,2113830,2119340,"Sometimes seeking access to subjects for the study, it’s difficult when the object is "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_394,2119340,2126790,"made explicit to them, but it, if it is not very obvious, the permission may be easily granted. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_395,2126790,2131550,The evidence suggests that the information about respond’s personality trait is obscured 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_396,2131550,2137340,by information about the respondent’s temporary state and by random noise produced by the 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_397,2137340,2138640,ambiguity to the procedure. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_398,2138640,2144470,"It may, therefore be said that projective techniques have not produced satisfactory "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_399,2144470,2149760,results and seems unlikely to match the widespread use of questionnaire. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_400,2149760,2154400,"So, in the end, we can only say that projective techniques and their application represent "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_401,2154400,2162190,"a point of significant intersection for psychology psychoanalytical theory, clinical psychology, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_402,2162190,2165320,"social psychology, and cultural anthropology. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_403,2165320,2171250,"These instruments include a vari… wide array of material, instructions, and interpretation "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_404,2171250,2176870,"rules, but in spite of their diversity, there are certain common qualities that distinguish "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_405,2176870,2183630,"them from other personality measures, such as inventories, ratings, or situation test. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_406,2183630,2189380,The most distinct feature of projective techniques concerns the presentation to the subject of 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_407,2189380,2192620,a task that is relatively unstructured. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_408,2192620,2199180,This lack of structure involves the ambiguous or vaguely defined stimuli and a relatively 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_409,2199180,2204610,unrestricted set of responses alternative by means of which the subject may assign meaning 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_410,2204610,2206410,to the stimulus material. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_411,2206410,2211660,It is generally assumed that in the process of choosing between the many alternatives 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_412,2211660,2217570,"the structuring or interpreting the ambiguous stimulus material, the subject reveals significant "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_413,2217570,2219860,and fundamental aspect of himself. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_414,2219860,2225490,"Ordinary, such devices are considered to be particularly responsive to latent or unconscious "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_415,2225490,2232020,components of the person and consistently there is a minimum of subject awareness and 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_416,2232020,2234250,concerning the purpose of test. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_417,2234250,2239290,The response data are typically profuse and often involves fantasy or imaginary crenation. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_418,2239290,2245690,The instruments are highly multidimensional that is they are intended to provide information 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_419,2245690,2248930,concerning a large number of personality dimensions. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_420,2248930,2255290,"So, one may conclude that if projective technique represents the royal road to the unconscious, "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_421,2255290,2260220,the necessary roadmaps have yet to become common knowledge. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_422,2260220,2264460,"Nevertheless, the instrument seem to have found a useful place within the psychologists "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_423,2264460,2267740,array of assessment tools. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_424,2267740,2272290,"So, this was the projective technique module. "
Module_29_Projective_Technique_425,2272290,2278140,I hope you have understood the concept and you are finding it very beneficial for your 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_426,2278140,2280350,un… study or understanding. 
Module_29_Projective_Technique_427,2280350,2281460,Thank you.

Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_1,34420,42750,"I am Himanshu Pandey, Assistant Professor, School of Law, Devi Ahilya Vishwa Vidyalaya, Indore.   "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_2,42750,64149,"Present module ‘Research Design’ containing study material on concept of research design, "

Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_5,79390,88420,Contents of these modules are focused and explained by this lecture. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_6,88420,97220,Research design is a very important aspect and very interesting part of every research study.  
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_7,97220,110299,"It contain the nature of that study process and methods and methodology, tools and technology applied therein.  "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_8,110299,116990,"Steps of the research, everything covers within this concept of research design. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_9,116990,122399,"In ordinary term, if we try to understand this concept, research design is a planning "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_10,122399,127399,of detailed outline of any research work. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_11,127399,136830,"That planning includes steps from the beginning to last, tools and techniques, particular "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_12,136830,140120,pattern of working that is method. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_13,140120,149109,"Specific scientific methods including the formulation of hypothesis, this is all the "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_14,149109,151680,part of research design. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_15,151680,157889,By this term design we can easily understand this is the shape of research and this shape 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_16,157889,165680,"of research can be designed in any way, this is the free wish of the researcher. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_17,165680,170660,But it should be objectively satisfied. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_18,170660,179150,"The nature of research design is shaped in the light of research problem, objectives "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_19,179150,187930,"of research, purposes attached therewith and limitations of that research study. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_20,187930,195680,"In other terms, we can understand research design, it works like a torch for to the researcher "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_21,195680,203459,to proceed in a particular direction to find out and conclude his research work. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_22,203459,213290,"It is a mandatory step designed in every research study, without designing the this this research "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_23,213290,219440,it is not possible to complete any research task. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_24,219440,229470,"Basically, it is the procedure linkages of research problem with its objectives and purposes of research.  "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_25,229470,237629,The research design should be the proper in the light of the objectives of research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_26,237629,247450,"Basically, designing, research designing is an independent choice of researcher, anyway "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_27,247450,251769,he wish he can pursue his research work. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_28,251769,260289,"But if he is unskilled, inexperienced, in that case he cannot follow any ideal procedure "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_29,260289,270469,which may provide him a satisfactory result. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_30,270469,281150,That is why it is necessary that to opt a secure way of doing any study. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_31,281150,287039,"This is the pattern of working research if the person is already familiar, experienced "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_32,287039,294170,"in doing research in any particular area of his study, he can follow that common pattern. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_33,294170,299320,"But if he has no experience, no knowledge, in that case it is better to go with the experienced "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_34,299320,313640,and potent followed by the previous researchers for researching their problem similar to present one. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_35,313640,320410,"This research design contain the procedure and method or in easy way, we can say this "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_36,320410,325720,is the blueprint of whole research work before going to start any task. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_37,325720,335480,"In ordinary sense, if you proceed for any task like any picnic, planning for picnic, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_38,335480,343440,"party, travelling, future planning, business planning or academic planning, before executing "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_39,343440,355230,"that planning the person draw certain sketch in his mind that how that act shall be proceeded, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_40,355230,365060,"what steps will be followed, what means will be used and how that matter shall be reached "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_41,365060,366780,on final stage. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_42,366780,372050,"Or what we can say, this is the strategy before starting the task. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_43,372050,378650,"Research des… design can be called as a strategy, strategy which is psychologically "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_44,378650,383670,designed by the person for performing every step of the transaction. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_45,383670,390830,"Similarly, in the research, this is a strategy which is designed by the researcher for performing "

Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_48,414270,417300,In the light of that strategy what person does? 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_49,417300,425440,"He design a blueprint, that means he describe that design in a parti… in any substance "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_50,425440,427459,in any manner. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_51,427459,435440,"This is a blueprint which is usually required for starting any work, this blueprint containing "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_52,435440,442370,both the substantive steps and procedural aspect involved therewith. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_53,442370,450669,The substantive principle which is the objective of research is always kept in mind while performing 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_54,450669,458550,the work through its procedure. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_55,458550,465919,This blueprint contain both basic strategy and the procedure and in the light of strategy

Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_57,471510,481800,and it works as a guide to researcher in the field that what shall be his further step 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_58,481800,488920,and what step is required to be taken by him in any particular appropriate manner.

Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_60,498149,501909,that is the formulation of research problem till the end of the research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_61,501909,507430,There is a question dispute regarding this particular aspect whether the research design 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_62,507430,512709,comes into action after formulation of research problem or before? 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_63,512709,518479,"Basically, the research process starts after formulation of research problem. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_64,518479,525500,But another view of the scientists they says that design means where the person apply his 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_65,525500,529780,mind to the subject. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_66,529780,536490,"And formulation of research problem, we find there is the involvement of the researcher "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_67,536490,539290,in shaping the research problem. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_68,539290,544529,"That means for the formulation of research problem, researcher has applied his mind and "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_69,544529,550050,"shaped the research problem, formulated the research problem in a certain shape. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_70,550050,555240,That is why on this precision it is also said that the formulation of research problem is 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_71,555240,560930,the part of research design. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_72,560930,571410,"Formulation of research, any research problem itself suggests that what shall be the basic "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_73,571410,580329,substantive next step of the researcher towards finding the research and following the procedure 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_74,580329,581329,within the research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_75,581329,589000,"Basically, research design depends on following things, first is the nature of research problem, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_76,589000,596319,"objectives of research, purposes of research and limitations of research. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_77,596319,603490,"On the basi… on this basis, objectives and purposes of research, research can be classified "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_78,603490,604490,in two category. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_79,604490,608740,One is substantive design and procedural design. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_80,608740,613600,"In every research, this research design is formulated in two stages. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_81,613600,619170,First is substantive part and second is procedural part. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_82,619170,628649,"In designing the substantive part, first comes substantive research design is the initial "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_83,628649,634660,"level of designing which ipso facto comes into shape on the basis of nature of problem, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_84,634660,642459,"objectives of research and purposes thereof, where researcher has no alternative choice "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_85,642459,646689,and no interference in the proceedings in the light of the objectives. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_86,646689,650329,He has to proceed in the light of the objectives. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_87,650329,661900,"According to the nature of problem, the objective of research may be descriptive, diagnostic, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_88,661900,667050,"remedial, comparative, experimental etcetera. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_89,667050,676279,"That means substantially, the researcher has to design the his research process with these "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_90,676279,688350,"objectives to explore, to describe or diagnose or compare any the facts or variables. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_91,688350,700860,"Before research designing, researcher should have the experience and skill, knowledge about "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_92,700860,706620,the steps and procedure to be followed in research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_93,706620,715410,"And if he has started research, he has to be vigilant at every stage of the proceeding, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_94,715410,721350,the process he is following during the research he should make it confirm whether it is in 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_95,721350,732700,conformity with the determined design or not and the procedure followed to pursue research 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_96,732700,740540,is significant for the objectivity of the research or not. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_97,740540,749540,"After the substantive shaping of the re… research part, second the procedural choice "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_98,749540,752769,comes with the researcher. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_99,752769,761300,"The researcher has freedom to select the tools, techniques and the procedure followed for "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_100,761300,772509,"data collection, research procedure whether it shall be the doctrinal research or empirical research. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_101,772509,785410,Researcher has scope of managing between the purpose and limitations of research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_102,785410,792790,"Certain defined purposes, the researcher has on which he has to focus during the research "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_103,792790,805730,"and at the same time he has certain limitations as to the time, fund or human resources. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_104,805730,815490,"For the sake of balancing between these two, the researcher prefer to follow those methods "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_105,815490,825829,"which are appropriate, workworthy and easy to handle and administer in the given situation. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_106,825829,833720,This is the freedom of researcher to design procedure of his research but he should also 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_107,833720,845470,be attentive on this part that his procedure should be designed in the light of the objectives 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_108,845470,850279,and purpose of the research to be studied. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_109,850279,860800,"Objectives and purpose of research design, it provides the basic shape "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_110,860800,869509,"by looking into the research design, one can easily understand that what research problem "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_111,869509,877019,has what is the nature of research problem undertaken by the researcher. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_112,877019,885569,It reflects the nature of research problem and objectives thereof. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_113,885569,895259,Research design also works as an instrument of that for directing the research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_114,895259,904100,It provides the direction that what action should be made by the researcher. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_115,904100,915100,"Research design contain the hypothesis, research methods selected by the researcher, tool and "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_116,915100,926720,"techniques for data collection, nature of data required for his study, all these steps "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_117,926720,936709,are guided by this research design to the researcher in his process of investigation. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_118,936709,944220,It also avoids the conflicting situation or confusing situation at any stage where the 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_119,944220,950149,researcher is in a fix that what should be his next step. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_120,950149,958449,"Ordinarily, he should proceed in the direction of the procedure prescribed in the design "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_121,958449,968279,"and sometimes if he find any problem or any such situation, in that case he can refer "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_122,968279,971619,the objectives of his research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_123,971619,978300,Procedural design provides the alternative choice to the researcher for balancing between 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_124,978300,983649,"his objective, purpose and limitations of research. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_125,983649,991660,There are various steps of research process which starts from the formulation of research 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_126,991660,1009620,"problem, review of literature, formulation of hypothesis, selection of area for research, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_127,1009620,1020819,"selection of variables to be studied, samples of study, methods of study tools and technology, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_128,1020819,1030720,procedure of data analysis and the way of interpretation of his research work. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_129,1030720,1046040,"On the basis of nature of objectives and the question to be determined through the research, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_130,1046040,1052500,"it can be classified between two categories, one is qualitative and quantitative research "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_131,1052500,1056590,and second one is doctrinal and empirical research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_132,1056590,1066230,"Because the legal research area is studied commonly by the doctrinal empirical method, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_133,1066230,1076090,"so as to nature of data is concerned and what nature of data is required for the enquiry, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_134,1076090,1082060,"what kind of enquiry is required, that is determined by the method that is qualitative "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_135,1082060,1089770,and quantitative research methods. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_136,1089770,1096800,"Qualitative and quantitative research methods, these are two form of design which makes the "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_137,1096800,1103550,classification on the basis of the enquiry to be made by the researcher. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_138,1103550,1113590,"If the objective of researcher is to enquire as to the facts, attributes, behavior of any "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_139,1113590,1120950,"person, in that case he has to go with the qualitative research. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_140,1120950,1127830,If he wants to measure the variables in where the data required for the research is in the 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_141,1127830,1135040,"numerical form, that is the method of quantitative design. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_142,1135040,1145140,This qualitative research design is ordinarily applied in social science researches including 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_143,1145140,1153930,"the legal research, especially for the legal research this is the prominent area of interest  "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_144,1153930,1162350,for the law scholars as to study the social behavior and to see the impact of law on their behavior.   
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_145,1162350,1171890,"Where the objective of research is to enquire the facts which is of the nature of behavior, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_146,1171890,1182000,"attributes or those variables, those facts which can be of narrative nature, that is "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_147,1182000,1189630,the subject matter of qualitative research and this design is operated and followed for 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_148,1189630,1199810,"knowing the qualitative data, has quest to know what it is, how it exist? "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_149,1199810,1202180,What is the relation? 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_150,1202180,1209670,All such questions can be answered by following this qualitative research method. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_151,1209670,1215920,The word qualitative implies and emphas… emphasize on the qualities of any entities 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_152,1215920,1228150,and on processes and meaning that are not experimentally examined or measured. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_153,1228150,1236960,Data of qualitative research is distinct from the data of quantitative research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_154,1236960,1242530,"Data of qualitative research is only observable, observed. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_155,1242530,1247820,The behavior of any person can be observed but it cannot be measured. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_156,1247820,1255990,"The personality traits of any person can be observed, non-measurable where the nature "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_157,1255990,1261550,of data for quantitative research is measurable and variable. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_158,1261550,1275790,"That means its quantity can vary which can be measured by on certain scales like frequency, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_159,1275790,1280900,strength of students in the class. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_160,1280900,1291550,"Qualitative method may be defined as the technique associated with the gathering, analysis, interpretation "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_161,1291550,1299430,and presentation of narrative information. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_162,1299430,1311420,The answer of qualitative analysis comes always in the narrative form. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_163,1311420,1320190,"After qualitative research design, the second research that is the quantitative research design. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_164,1320190,1327360,By the term you can easily understand that quantitative research design means the design 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_165,1327360,1337950,"which used to deal with the numbers, statistics and mathematical variables. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_166,1337950,1343320,"Quantitative method may be defined as the techniques associated with the gathering, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_167,1343320,1355520,analysis and interpretation and presentation of numerical information. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_168,1355520,1364240,The primary objective of quantitative design is to investigate those facts which are of 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_169,1364240,1373990,"the numerical nature, which can be verified or which can be measured on certain scales. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_170,1373990,1383840,Though the qualitative characteristics has also made vari… variable and estimable by 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_171,1383840,1391920,"the scaling method in the social science techniques, the scaling method is used to convert the "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_172,1391920,1400130,qualitative data into the quantitative one and it is analyzed in the quantitative form 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_173,1400130,1408060,"and after analysis whatever the numerical result comes, on that basis the interpretation "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_174,1408060,1415900,of any behavior or attributes is given. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_175,1415900,1431260,"The areas of study in the quantitative research may be the statistical analysis, comparison, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_176,1431260,1445970,sensors and all those investigations where the data required in the numerical form. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_177,1445970,1457310,"After analyzing, discussing about the qualitative and quantitative methods on the basis of their "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_178,1457310,1472160,"distinct approach as to the nature of investigation, the nature of data, the second way of understanding "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_179,1472160,1480740,"the research design that is on the basis of the nature of data, that is doctrinal and "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_180,1480740,1482820,empirical research design. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_181,1482820,1493990,Doctrinal and empirical research designs are commonly used in legal research and doctrinal 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_182,1493990,1505630,research design is frequently and prominently used in legal research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_183,1505630,1514590,"Distinction between these two kinds of design, one is doctrinal, second one is empirical, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_184,1514590,1525460,can be understand on the basis of the terms used to denote this design. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_185,1525460,1534500,"First is doctrinal research design, doctrinal research design is a design which is commonly "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_186,1534500,1548490,used to study the facts in library or through participation in all those activities with 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_187,1548490,1557500,information comes from the credible source. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_188,1557500,1565020,"By the term you can easily understand doctrine, doctrine means any principle and principle "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_189,1565020,1571500,"means all those facts, information which are deemed true. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_190,1571500,1578650,"In our day to day life, we use to rely on the informations, universal facts, we do not "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_191,1578650,1582960,go into investigation and test those facts. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_192,1582960,1593840,"Merely on the basis of their acceptability, they are they become the principle. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_193,1593840,1601680,"On this approach, we can understand the data relied only on the basis of truthness that "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_194,1601680,1611720,the data data which comes from any source of information and that source of information is credible. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_195,1611720,1620410,"In that case, there is no need to test or investigate the fact in real social circumstances. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_196,1620410,1627080,It provides the convenience to researcher to proceed his research on the basis of information 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_197,1627080,1631930,which is in the form of doctrinal nature. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_198,1631930,1642580,"In legal research, there are basically three sources of authority that is legislative, "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_199,1642580,1647650,judicial and the custom. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_200,1647650,1658760,"Wherever any information exists in our society in the form of legislative texts, precedents "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_201,1658760,1667150,"and existed cust… customs, in that case the researcher investigate and search the "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_202,1667150,1675770,"data, analyze the data within the propounded principles provided by these authoritative sources. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_203,1675770,1687640,"In doctrinal research, the researcher can collect the data from library by looking into "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_204,1687640,1701020,"the books, journals, other documentary material where he has reason of satisfaction that first "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_205,1701020,1704870,that the information comes from the credible source. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_206,1704870,1715160,"The person who is generating this information is somewhere expert, authoritative or experienced "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_207,1715160,1725210,"person, only then he has reason to rely him and second that the information coming from "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_208,1725210,1728450,the source is relevant to his work. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_209,1728450,1736250,If he satisfied on these two stages and if he has no scope of doubt as to the truthness 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_210,1736250,1744740,"of the information, he can accept that information for his research where the research is performed "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_211,1744740,1749680,on this principle that is the doctrinal research method. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_212,1749680,1756070,"Next, doctrinal research method, a method which is commonly used in socio-legal research "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_213,1756070,1763480,that is empirical research and also known as non-doctrinal research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_214,1763480,1771310,"Whereas the empirical research, researcher does not rely on the information coming from "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_215,1771310,1777460,"the second source, coming from other sources, there is no reliance on the credibility of "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_216,1777460,1778680,the information. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_217,1778680,1787510,"In that case, he directly go in the society to observe the facts, collect those facts "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_218,1787510,1794330,through vari… various techniques and tools and thereafter analyze them and comes with 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_219,1794330,1800640,the conclusion as to the existence of any fact or information in the society. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_220,1800640,1813030,"The approach behind these two methods, doctrinal and empirical, in doctrinal method works only "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_221,1813030,1823090,"on the basis of credibility of source, relevancy of information and assumption as to the truthness "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_222,1823090,1824390,of the information. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_223,1824390,1835790,"Whereas empirical research relies on the investigation of the researcher, reliability of tools and "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_224,1835790,1845600,"techniques applied for the data collection, their proper analysis and the final conclusion "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_225,1845600,1857090,comes after focusing on all the aspects relating to the research designing. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_226,1857090,1866370,This lecture can be summarized as the research design is first and important aspect which 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_227,1866370,1870660,provides the shape to any research work. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_228,1870660,1879690,It is a blueprint of research which is designed and shaped in the light of this formulation 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_229,1879690,1888800,"of research problem, research objectives and purposes attached therewith. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_230,1888800,1901820,It provides the procedural direction to the research in the light of the purpose and limitations of research. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_231,1901820,1916280,"Research design contain all the steps, techniques, methodology, methods of the research study. "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_232,1916280,1932120,And at last I suggest that the researcher should free from external models suggested 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_233,1932120,1939810,"he should take his own decision in the light of the objective of research, purpose of research "
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_234,1939810,1941040,and limitations thereof. 
Module_11_Methods_of_Data_Collection_235,1941040,1943370,"Thank you, good bye!  "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_0,190,1190,Hello everyone. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_1,1190,2190,Welcome back. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_2,2190,4750,I hope you are learning a lot. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_3,4750,11599,"And today, we are going to discuss Content Analysis as a part of the Research Methodology module only. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_4,11599,15669,"And if you remember, I am Doctor Ritu Sharma from National Law University and today I am "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_5,15669,19220,going to deal with the concept of Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_6,19220,22290,"So, while discussing the concept of Content an… "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_7,22290,27070,"Analysis, we will try to understand the meaning of it and the definitions of Content Analysis. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_8,27070,32829,Then try to understand the characteristics of Content Analysis and the steps and processes 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_9,32829,34920,that are there in Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_10,34920,40440,We will also try to examine the sources of Content Analysis and try to understand the 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_11,40440,44149,advantages and disadvantages of the technique. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_12,44149,50460,"So, Content Analysis is a technique of interpreting various kinds of textual material to arrive "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_13,50460,52469,at a valid inference. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_14,52469,59890,It analyzes various documents systematically and converts qualitative datas into a quantitative data. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_15,59890,66500,"This method is commonly used in social sciences, but has recently gained property in other discipline as well. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_16,66500,72030,Content Analysis is a method of summarizing the various aspects of contents in the form 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_17,72030,79950,of material or documents and is a very objective evaluatent… of the material under analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_18,79950,84350,It is not to be confused with book review or summarizing television shows. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_19,84350,86800,They are also Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_20,86800,93620,A Content Analysis been ala… analyzed written material and change into numbers and percentage. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_21,93620,98480,"So Content Analysis is one of the classical procedure for analyzing textual material, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_22,98480,101630,be it interview or media products. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_23,101630,107720,"It differs from coding in the sense that rather than generating categories from the data themselves, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_24,107720,114400,it uses categories brought from the outside and fits the empirical materially against 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_25,114400,118870,"them, of course, modifying the categories wherever necessary. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_26,118870,123920,"Content Analysis, though it often analyzes written words is a quantitative method. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_27,123920,128340,The result of Content Analysis are numbers and percentage. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_28,128340,133460,So it can be used in giving results both in quantitative as well as qualitative form. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_29,133460,139510,One of the best example of Content Analysis is the analysis done by some researcher during 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_30,139510,146980,"nineteen eighty four was that of violence against six, Sikhs as reported in newspapers and magazines. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_31,146980,153580,"For understanding the concept of Content Analysis, we should first understand the meaning of content. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_32,153580,159130,One can say that a content denotes what is contained and Content Analysis is the analysis 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_33,159130,161690,of what is contained in a message. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_34,161690,168310,"Acc… According to Nachmias and Nachmias, “Broadly Content Analysis may be seen as a method where "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_35,168310,175360,the content of the message forms the basis for drawing inferences and conclusion about the content.” 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_36,175360,182650,"They further say that, “The Content Analysis falls in the interface of observation and document analysis.” "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_37,182650,189150,Kerlinger calls it as a method of observation in the sense that instead of asking people 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_38,189150,196970,"to respond to questions, it takes the communication that people have produced and ask questions of communication. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_39,196970,204180,"Therefore, it is also considered as an unobtrusive or non-reactive method of social research. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_40,204180,209400,A number of definition of Content Analysis are given by various researchers. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_41,209400,216120,"According to Berelson, “Content Analysis is a research technique for the objective, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_42,216120,221790,systematic and quantitative description of the manifested content of communication.” 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_43,221790,229590,Holsti on the other hand say that it is “any technique of for making inferences by systematically 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_44,229590,234010,and objectively identifying special characteristic of messages.” 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_45,234010,240780,"While defining Content Analysis Kerlinger says that, “Content analysis as a method "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_46,240780,247060,"of studying and analyzing communication in a systematic, objective and quantifying manner "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_47,247060,251190,for the purpose of measuring variables.” 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_48,251190,256329,Krippendorff defines Content Analysis as a “Research technique for making replicable 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_49,256329,260220,and valid inferences from date to their context.” 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_50,260220,266910,"As for Weber, “It is the Research Methodology that utilizes a set of procedure to make valid "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_51,266910,269820,and inferences from text. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_52,269820,276211,"These inferences are about sender’s messages, the message itself, or the audience of the messages.” "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_53,276211,282340,"According to Stone, “Content Analysis refers to any procedure for assessing the relative "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_54,282340,291550,"extent to which specified reference, attitude, or themes permeate a given message or document.” "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_55,291550,296590,Meaning of the and definition of Content Analysis – Content Analysis is a method of social 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_56,296590,303710,"research that aims at the analysis of the content quality and or quantitative of document, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_57,303710,307540,"books, newspaper, magazines and other forms of written material. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_58,307540,312889,"According to Berelson, “Content Analysis is a research technique for the objective, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_59,312889,319040,systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content of communication.” 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_60,319040,324120,The word ‘communication’ here refers to “available written material or print media.” 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_61,324120,327490,The word ‘manifest’ means ‘which is presented outwardly’. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_62,327490,330260,"It thus, exclude the implied meaning. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_63,330260,337610,"According to Eckhardt and Ermann, as a qualify qualitative technique, Content Analysis is "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_64,337610,344690,"directed towards more subjective information such as attitude, motivate motives and values, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_65,344690,352919,while a quantitative method is employed when determining the time frequency of duration of the event. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_66,352919,360150,"In the latter context, it also makes inferences about conduct, intentions, ideologies, sentiments "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_67,360150,361440,and values of the individual groups. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_68,361440,368860,"The content, in Content Analysis may be manifest or latent. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_69,368860,373759,"The former refers to the visible actual part of the text as manifested in the document, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_70,373759,376500,"that is sentences, paragraph and so on. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_71,376500,380949,It involves counting frequency of appearance of the research unit. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_72,380949,384979,The latter is the underlying or implied meaning conveyed. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_73,384979,391330,Here the researcher reads between the lines and analyzes the hidden meaning significant 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_74,391330,394070,for the object of the study. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_75,394070,401340,"Gardner describes it as “A research method for the investigating problem, which the content "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_76,401340,404240,of communication serves as a basis of inferences.” 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_77,404240,410490,"At other stage he says, “Content Analysis is a technique for making inferences by systematically "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_78,410490,416590,and objectively identifying specified characteristics of message or communication.” 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_79,416590,422840,All the definition help us to understand that in Content Analysis emphasis is placed on 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_80,422840,427940,"aspects such as system, objectivity, quantification, and context. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_81,427940,434140,"The Content Analysis is all about making valid, replicable and objective inferences about "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_82,434140,437770,the message on the basis of explicit rules. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_83,437770,443240,"The material for the Content Analysis can be letters, diaries, newspaper, content, folk "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_84,443240,450600,"songs, short stories, message, radio, television, documents, text or any other symbol. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_85,450600,454340,Let us discuss some characteristics of Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_86,454340,458080,Gardner has referred to four characteristics of Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_87,458080,463250,They are objectivity that is carrying out analysis on the basis of explicitly formulated 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_88,463250,470690,"rules, which will enable two or more persons to obtain the same results from the same documents. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_89,470690,476830,"Secondly, systematic, that is including and excluding the content or categories according "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_90,476830,480710,to consistency applied criteria of selection. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_91,480710,487419,This eliminated analysis in which only materials sup… supporting the investigators hypothesis are examined. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_92,487419,492490,"Third is generality, that is findings must have theoretical relevance. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_93,492490,498240,"Purely descriptive information about content, unrelated to other attributes of content or "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_94,498240,503110,to the cha… characteristics of the sender or recipient of the communication is of the 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_95,503110,507010,little scientific values. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_96,507010,515169,"Then is quantification, that is the answers of the question raised should be a quantitative terms. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_97,515169,521260,Some scholars like Kaplan and Goldsen equate the term quantitative with numerical that 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_98,521260,525240,is classifying content in prescribed numerical terms. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_99,525240,530810,This means that inferences must be derived strictly from counts of frequency. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_100,530810,537410,It also means that information should be conveyed as “Forty percent people or forty out of 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_101,537410,543940,"hundred people had this opinion,” because it is more precise than the statement “less "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_102,543940,547930,than half or a large number of people had this opinion.” 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_103,547930,555390,"But others say that qualitative and quantitativeness are not dichotomous attributes, but fall along "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_104,555390,562730,"a continuum, that is, inferences are drawn from the combined frequencies and non-frequency techniques. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_105,562730,569160,"Despite the advantages of quantitative method, the tendency to equate Content Analysis with "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_106,569160,573230,tabulation of frequency has been criticized on a number of grounds. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_107,573230,580230,"One, the most important argument is that such a restriction leads to a bias in the selection "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_108,580230,583130,of problem to be investigated. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_109,583130,588540,Undue emphasis is placed on precision at the cost of the problem significance. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_110,588540,596100,Other arguments is that more meaningful inferences can be drawn by non-quantitative measure. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_111,596100,602040,Qualitative analysis is more superior to the problems of applied social sciences. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_112,602040,608850,The proponent of qualitative techniques also question the assumption of the proponent of 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_113,608850,610430,the qualitative technique. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_114,610430,620320,"For purpose of inferences, frequency of assertion is necessarily related to the importance of assumption. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_115,620320,625630,"They, that is proponent of the qualitative techniques, say that the single appearance "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_116,625630,634560,or omission of an attribute to in a document may be or of more significance than the relative 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_117,634560,636860,frequency other than the characteristics. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_118,636860,644300,"Whether stated explicitly or not, even the most rigorous qualitative study uses quantitative "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_119,644300,648610,techniques at some stage in the research. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_120,648610,652930,"So, as steps in the let’s understand the steps in the Content Analysis. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_121,652930,658900,"According to Sarantakos, Content Analysis involves the same steps as in the method of "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_122,658900,664670,"research, namely selection of the area of the search, formulation of the research topic, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_123,664670,669030,"designing research, collecting data and analyzing data. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_124,669030,675430,The difference in Content Analysis and other methods lies only in the content of each step. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_125,675430,680680,"In the selection of the research area, the topic can be one, whose various aspects are "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_126,680680,684640,"discussed by the newspaper, magazines, books, TV , and movies. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_127,684640,693730,"For example, a communal violence, match fixing, police expresses at the police station, cast "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_128,693730,695870,"conflicts, violence, etcetera. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_129,695870,702210,"So, formulation of research topic involves explaining and operationalizing the topic, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_130,702210,706490,"selection of units, determining categories and formulating hypothesis. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_131,706490,713079,"Research design aims at determining the size of sampling, method of collecting data and "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_132,713079,715250,method of checking reliability. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_133,715250,721790,"Data collection involves counting frequencies, gathering information on the intensity of "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_134,721790,727829,"the units, determining significance of units and evaluating unit and intensity of the statement. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_135,727829,734480,"Lastly, the analysis and interpretation of data aims at giving inferences and conclusion. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_136,734480,738380,The processes involved in the Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_137,738380,742870,The research through Content Analysis involves four methods. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_138,742870,751550,"One, specifying the problem, two, sampling, three, choosing units for analysis, four, category construction. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_139,751550,756220,We shall analyze each of these categories separately. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_140,756220,763800,Specifying the problem – This aims at identifying the specific research questions in the problem selected. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_141,763800,768089,Ram Ahuja illustrates this by giving an example of caste violence in Bihar. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_142,768089,775360,"The research questions could be, “What senas are formed by different lower and upper caste? "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_143,775360,778810,B – What are the prominent castes involved? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_144,778810,781930,C – What are the main causes of violence? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_145,781930,786630,D – What are the geographical areas of their concentration? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_146,786630,790010,Which political party support different caste? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_147,790010,797190,F – Whom do the Naxalites support and how has the the support increased the intensity of violence? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_148,797190,803350,G – What has been the role of police and paramilitary forces in controlling violence? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_149,803350,810380,Spelling out these and other similar questions enable a researcher to narrow down his focus 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_150,810380,814320,so that he can collect data around these questions. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_151,814320,820670,"The problem has also to be specified theoretically in terms of the theories on collective violence, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_152,820670,827269,"political behavior, mutual interdependence of caste and jajmani system, formation of "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_153,827269,832750,"political parties on caste basis, seeking votes on the caste basis, and forming ministries "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_154,832750,835230,on the caste basis and so on. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_155,835230,842120,Logically this will determine the attention of the researchers to the kind of data sources 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_156,842120,847899,"that is books and journals dealing with these themes, say, caste and politics in India, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_157,847899,852170,"jajmani system, collective violence, police and violence, and so forth. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_158,852170,860550,These books and journals will provide an opportunity to the researcher for more rigorous comparative 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_159,860550,862700,and theoretical analysis than data source might. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_160,862700,868240,"So, sampling here refers to the sampling of newspaper, magazines and books, TV serial "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_161,868240,869800,"songs, novels, etcetera. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_162,869800,876800,Sampling of books means sampling of old and new books and popular magazines known for their analytical views. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_163,876800,882980,"Taking Ram Ahuja’s example further on caste violence in Bihar, one can sa… sample out "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_164,882980,890360,"magazines like India Today, The Week, Outlook, Frontline, Seminar and Economic Political Weekly. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_165,890360,896000,"Among books could be sampling of old books published in nineteen fifties, sixties, seventies "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_166,896000,901070,and early nineteen eighties dealing with Bihar problems or new biks… books published in 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_167,901070,905510,nineteen eighties and nineteen nighties and in two thousands. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_168,905510,911300,This sampled material will enable researcher to give some elegant theoretical statements. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_169,911300,917339,It should be remembered that sampling in the case of Content Analysis is a multistage process. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_170,917339,922589,"Even when the researcher decides to focus on specific magazines and journals, will he "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_171,922589,926980,be able to go through all the issues of the magazines of last fifty years. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_172,926980,931800,Would it be feasible for him to read between fifteen hundred to two fif… two thousand 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_173,931800,937029,five hundred issues of each of the eight or ten magazines mentioned above? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_174,937029,943300,"Therefore, money and manpower requires the sampling to be confined to specific period "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_175,943300,944880,in multistage process. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_176,944880,947820,"So, choosing the unit of analysis. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_177,947820,954190,"After determining the sampled material for scrutiny, the question arises, what exactly "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_178,954190,956769,ought to be the unit for analysis? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_179,956769,962010,"Should unit of analysis be words like violence, aggression, etcetera., sentences, paragraphs, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_180,962010,965550,"chapters, or whole book or magazines? "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_181,965550,972200,"Researchers have to setup categories for tabulation, the theme, persons, behavior, and so on. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_182,972200,975870,Gardner has pointed out following units of analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_183,975870,984230,"First, the single word, this is used more ris… more on research in psychotherapy and literary direction. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_184,984230,987380,"The theme of the subject- Example, propaganda, advertisement, values, advertisement, values, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_185,987380,988380,"attitude, violence, etcetera. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_186,988380,1000930,"The character, that is the socio economic, marital, psychological, and other traits of character. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_187,1000930,1004760,This is used more in mass media and research. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_188,1004760,1012579,"The sentence or the paragraph, this is more used in the mass media involving a great volume of data. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_189,1012579,1020190,"The item – That is the entire book, film, article, or radio program is characterized the context units.  "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_190,1020190,1027829,Category construction – This refers to the classifying the content of the material being investigated. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_191,1027829,1034069,The constructed category must reflect the major theoretical concepts on which the study is based. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_192,1034069,1039429,"For example, in the illustration of caste violence some useful category should be status "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_193,1039429,1045829,"of caste, occupational aspiration of caste, power in interaction, personality characteristic "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_194,1045829,1048049,"of caste leader, etcetera. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_195,1048049,1052720,Creating completely exhaustive category is not an easy task. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_196,1052720,1059039,"Among the type of category used frequently in Content Analysis research, Berelson has "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_197,1059039,1060749,suggested the following. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_198,1060749,1066129,A. ‘What is said category’ and B.  ‘How it is said category’. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_199,1066129,1068539,Subject matter- What is the communication about? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_200,1068539,1071440,Direction- How is the subject matter related? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_201,1071440,1079220,Standard- What is the basis which the classification is made- What values and goals are revealed? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_202,1079220,1081889,Methods- What means are used to achieve goals? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_203,1081889,1085759,Traits- What are the characteristics used in description of people? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_204,1085759,1090470,Actor- Who is represented as undertaking certain acts? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_205,1090470,1093769,Authority- In whose name are statements made? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_206,1093769,1096289,Origin- Where does the communication originated? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_207,1096289,1102489,Target- To what person or group is the communication directed to? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_208,1102489,1105619,Location- Where does the action takes place? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_209,1105619,1108619,Conflict- What are the sources and levels of conflict? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_210,1108619,1112529,And finally the time- When does the action takes place? 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_211,1112529,1118470,"So, how is said category talks about the type of communication, like what is the medium "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_212,1118470,1121840,"of communication, newspaper, TV , movie, etcetera. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_213,1121840,1126279,"Then, form of statement- What is the form of communication? "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_214,1126279,1130539,"And then, device- What is the propagandist method used? "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_215,1130539,1135840,"Now, once we have constructed the categories, let’s understand the sources of data for "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_216,1135840,1137690,the Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_217,1137690,1143519,"Since, Content Analysis is done through written material, five sources are said to be important "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_218,1143519,1144710,in collecting data. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_219,1144710,1154379,"These are printed material, that is, newspaper, books, magazines, documents, filmed material, and records. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_220,1154379,1156940,Newspaper are the most widely available form of written words. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_221,1156940,1163520,"They are not only reports national, international, state and local events, but also deal with "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_222,1163520,1166570,"social, political, economic, and cultural issues. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_223,1166570,1173139,They present the opinion of the intellectual expert as well as the common people. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_224,1173139,1176440,Newspaper does provide a wealth of information. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_225,1176440,1180429,Books and magazines too serve as a possible source of Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_226,1180429,1186179,"Various collection of books, magazines and documents available in vari… libraries could "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_227,1186179,1193509,be used for examining anything from simple to complex issues or from old to current topic. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_228,1193509,1198929,Documents available in the archives may be more difficult to obtain and if available 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_229,1198929,1202140,"at all, requires special handling and care. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_230,1202140,1207759,"Many a times, letters let… written to the relatives, kins, or friends or acquaintance, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_231,1207759,1213559,reveal fascinating views on the social situation during the specific period of history. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_232,1213559,1217480,Films including videotapes provide another sources of data. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_233,1217480,1224029,"By analyzing the content of film, one can pick out themselves issue and belief for analysis. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_234,1224029,1230450,"Records are obtained through sorting out files from offices, archives, college libraries, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_235,1230450,1232749,"information center, etcetera. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_236,1232749,1239789,"Example, correspondence between Viceroys and Congress leaders during the struggle for freedom "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_237,1239789,1241619,that can also be obtained. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_238,1241619,1247649,"The Parliament record contains all the speeches, testimonies and other bits of information "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_239,1247649,1250399,that occur in legislative bodies. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_240,1250399,1256320,"Some records may not be easily available for Content Analysis, example, inter-office memos. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_241,1256320,1262070,The police and courtroom record are also not made available to criminology and sociology 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_242,1262070,1265240,researchers for the Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_243,1265240,1271979,"Some records become highly restrictive when the researchers want to them to study scam, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_244,1271979,1275330,particularly involving highly-placed politicians and bureaucrats. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_245,1275330,1281299,"In one case, even the Supreme Court of India had to admonish the CBI when it reported the "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_246,1281299,1286349,loss of records required for scrutinizing purchase worth crores of rupees. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_247,1286349,1292960,"Since, the Content Analysis is dependent on the access to documents, it is doubtful that "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_248,1292960,1299409,much can be done without these secret records that can tell us a great deal about the inner 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_249,1299409,1302330,working of our government and its institutions. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_250,1302330,1307019,"Now, let us understand the type of Content Analysis. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_251,1307019,1311399,Sanders and Pinhey have suggested five types of Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_252,1311399,1318629,"First, word counting analysis, second, conceptual analysis, semantic analysis, evaluative assertion "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_253,1318629,1321630,"analysis, and contextual ana… analysis. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_254,1321630,1327380,All these types of Content Analysis can be explained beautifully with the help of examples 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_255,1327380,1331129,explained by Ram Ahuja in his book on Research Methodology. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_256,1331129,1338409,Word counting analysis – This is counting the use of certain keywords in different texts. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_257,1338409,1343440,"For example, one can count the word ‘democracy’ and ‘totalitarianism’ to measure the degree "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_258,1343440,1352899,"of democratization in five nation India, England, Canada, France in a simp… sample of elite newspapers. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_259,1352899,1358629,The object could be to find out whether there were any blatant difference between the nation 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_260,1358629,1361200,as represented by elite newspapers. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_261,1361200,1365149,This may involves several months and numerous codes and analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_262,1365149,1372429,"Similarly, terrorism and authoritarianism can be studied in Pakistan, Israel, af… Afghanistan, etcetera. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_263,1372429,1377529,Then is conceptual analysis – This is the analysis of wo… words grouped into conceptual 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_264,1377529,1378830,clusters or ideas. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_265,1378830,1383629,The constructive variable in in a research hypothesis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_266,1383629,1389249,"For example, a conceptual cluster may be formed around the ideas of deviance. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_267,1389249,1395389,"Words like crime, anomie, corruption, assault, juvenile delinquency, sexual harassment, embezzlement, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_268,1395389,1400399,"etcetera., could be, could all be clustered around ‘deviance’. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_269,1400399,1406070,"Using conceptual analysis, a researcher wants to find relationship between public concern "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_270,1406070,1411150,in different sectors of society through the analysis of newspaper articles that attempts 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_271,1411150,1415379,to connect one sector with the another. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_272,1415379,1420679,Semantic analysis – In this the researcher would be interested not only in the type of 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_273,1420679,1427669,"words used, but also in scaling their intensity weights, like using weak and strong words, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_274,1427669,1430219,"positive and negative words, and so on. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_275,1430219,1436419,"For positive and strong word, plus score would be used and for negative and weak words, minus "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_276,1436419,1437639,score would be used. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_277,1437639,1442969,"For example, love plus two, dislike minus one, and so on. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_278,1442969,1449659,"Measuring these positive and negative scores, community’s feeling can be assessed through Content Analysis. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_279,1449659,1453289,Then then is evaluation assertion analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_280,1453289,1459119,Suppose relation between labour and entrepreneurs are to be analyzed during the labour movement 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_281,1459119,1465330,through Content Analysis of newspaper articles by finding out how one treated the other by 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_282,1465330,1471789,"use of certain words, it becomes possible to point out the condition that lead to strike. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_283,1471789,1477450,"And finally, contextual analysis – This is to, this is used to predict future verbal "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_284,1477450,1482379,behavior based on the analysis of known words and concepts. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_285,1482379,1488260,"For example, by use of words like militant, firing, bombing, explosion, etcetera., one "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_286,1488260,1492679,can establish scale for known verbal behavior. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_287,1492679,1496460,Sarantakos has indicated five types of Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_288,1496460,1503220,First one is descriptive analysis- Where analysis means counting the frequency in appearance 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_289,1503220,1509149,of certain elements of the research question and comparing it with the other element. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_290,1509149,1515659,Second is categorical analysis- Where analysis involves a study of the documents by means 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_291,1515659,1523099,"of set of categories producing nominal as well as ordinal and interval data, which are "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_292,1523099,1525229,then processed statistically. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_293,1525229,1532580,Intensity analysis- Which is processed by means of multi-step scales based on theoretical criteria. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_294,1532580,1538529,Then contingency analysis- Which is basically a semantic analysis that is usually employed 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_295,1538529,1543440,to make an inference from the text about the personality of the author. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_296,1543440,1550559,"And finally, contextual analysis- Where sequence in which concept appears together is examined. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_297,1550559,1555762,"The systematic appearance is not considered accidental, but it expresses the, a thinking "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_298,1555762,1556762,pattern of the author. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_299,1556762,1568220,The aim of the qualitative Content Analysis is to reduce the material so as to make it manageable. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_300,1568220,1573929,"Summarizing the Content Analysis – Here the material is paraphrased, that is omitting "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_301,1573929,1580169,less relevant passages or those having the same meaning are reduced. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_302,1580169,1585700,"Thus, the material becomes more coherent, economical, and manageable. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_303,1585700,1592779,It is a kind of editing of the material in the order to draw out its essence. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_304,1592779,1595960,Explicable Content Analysis – This work in opposite way. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_305,1595960,1602710,"Here, statements which are puzzling, contradictory, or unclear are explained or clear clarified "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_306,1602710,1608340,by keeping in mind their context or by looking for clues in other parts of the text that 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_307,1608340,1611639,would help make their meaning clear. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_308,1611639,1616919,Then structuring Content Analysis – Here the researcher looks for type or formal structure 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_309,1616919,1623389,in the material by applying categories that emerged at the stage of formulating the research 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_310,1623389,1626139,"question itself, and organizing the material accordingly. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_311,1626139,1632690,"Thus, qualitative Content Analysis helps the researcher to reduce to manageable level large "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_312,1632690,1639200,"masses of text using a uniform scheme of categories, which also helps the comparison of different "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_313,1639200,1642039,cases to which is applied throughout. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_314,1642039,1648649,"According to Berelson, following five procedures can be used to determine the objectivity in "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_315,1648649,1649649,Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_316,1649649,1651919,First is the rule guide procedure. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_317,1651919,1657739,It may be said that the objectivity in Content Analysis requires three criti… criteria. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_318,1657739,1663399,What is important is not the categories developed by researcher for analyzing the content material 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_319,1663399,1668789,"or the procedures adopted for placing a unit of communication in one or another category, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_320,1668789,1675649,but to spell out the rules and methods used by the researcher so that it could be evaluated 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_321,1675649,1679389,how conclusion wo… were reached. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_322,1679389,1684070,"Secondly, systematic procedure- Besides the rule guiding procedure, which could be replicated "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_323,1684070,1690009,by other researchers adopted the adopting the systematic procedure also contributes 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_324,1690009,1693549,to the objectivity of the Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_325,1693549,1698960,"Then, quantitative description- Counting the frequencies appearing in different papers, "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_326,1698960,1703419,magazines and communications and comparing their validity is essential. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_327,1703419,1707519,This is to assess the intensity of a particular variable. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_328,1707519,1712960,Qualitative data becomes more valid when it is quantitatively assessed. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_329,1712960,1715009,Focus on the qualitative analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_330,1715009,1721769,Merely concentrating on counting the frequency in Content Analysis will be missing the overall 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_331,1721769,1724330,sense of a body of communication. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_332,1724330,1731339,"Therefore, both quantitative and qualitative technique must be used in conjunction with one another. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_333,1731339,1734789,Assessing only the manifest content of communication. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_334,1734789,1739849,"It has already been stated that besides the manifest content, there could be the latent "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_335,1739849,1746270,content too in which the researcher has to read between the lines and give meaning to 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_336,1746270,1749029,to it as he perceives it. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_337,1749029,1751269,This affects the objectivity of the analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_338,1751269,1758639,"It is, therefore, necessary that emphasis be given only what appears explicitly in communication. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_339,1758639,1764769,This does not mean that the researcher will totally refrain from engaging in any interpretation 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_340,1764769,1766450,of the material studied. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_341,1766450,1770460,"Without interpretation, how could content be analyzed? "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_342,1770460,1776960,Then let’s discuss the advantage and disadvantages of the Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_343,1776960,1780649,Ram Ahuja has given following advantages and disadvantages of Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_344,1780649,1787820,One of the significant advantage of Content Analysis is that it is thoroughly unobtrusive 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_345,1787820,1791629,method that is it has no effect on the subject being studied. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_346,1791629,1797139,"In other methods like interview, observation, experiment, etcetera., the researcher is directly "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_347,1797139,1799759,involved with the person. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_348,1799759,1806880,Content Analysis eliminates the source of responses bias that threatens research whenever 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_349,1806880,1810730,the respondents are directly questioned or observed. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_350,1810730,1816629,It can be used as a reliable central technique in historical research concerned with the 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_351,1816629,1822839,particular period or with friends over time by studying people who are no longer available 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_352,1822839,1824549,to answer the questions. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_353,1824549,1830799,"Thirdly, it makes possible to a possible a variety of cross cultural studies that would "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_354,1830799,1835289,likely be unfeasible using the other methods. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_355,1835289,1844259,"And finally, it can be used to test preliminary ideas, hypothesis or theories prior to a more complete investigation. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_356,1844259,1848669,It is powerful tool for evaluating personal social values. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_357,1848669,1854820,People are more candid while writing down the thoughts than when confrontely it by interviewer 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_358,1854820,1856509,or a questionnaire. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_359,1856509,1862049,"Therefore, studying society where people are more literate, Content Analysis proves to "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_360,1862049,1863719,be a more reliable method of research. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_361,1863719,1870200,Thit… met… This method is more useful when research budget is small and resources are limited. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_362,1870200,1874139,It is easier to repeat the study through this method. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_363,1874139,1878869,Repetition of study through other method may not be feasible either because the event under 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_364,1878869,1884509,"study may no longer exist or because of cost, time, and money. "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_365,1884509,1890009,"Since, Content Analysis is a heavily planned method, it lacks the spontaneity and unplanned "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_366,1890009,1891899,qualities of field research. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_367,1891899,1893789,Determining validity is difficult. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_368,1893789,1900519,"For example, did the newspaper give the real values and feelings of the workers during the strike? "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_369,1900519,1901519,Probably not. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_370,1901519,1907230,Some required documents may not be available to the researcher which may affect the conclusion 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_371,1907230,1910259,and it is susceptible to coder bias. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_372,1910259,1913909,In this module we have understood the concept of Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_373,1913909,1920249,It is a technique of interpreting various kinds of textual material to arrive at valid inference. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_374,1920249,1925669,It analyzes various documents systematically and converts qualitative data into quantitative data. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_375,1925669,1930979,We have also understood various types of Content Analysis and the various steps that are to 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_376,1930979,1934259,be taken during the process of Content Analysis. 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_377,1934259,1940080,"Finally, we see some advantages and disadvantages of this, but this is the best method that "
Module_27_Content_Analysis_378,1940080,1945899,can be adopted for making any kind of qualitative research into a quantitative research and 
Module_27_Content_Analysis_379,1945899,1951779,it is nowadays used very much in various kinds of social sciences and communication sciences. 
Module_22_Scaling_0,179,2100,"Hello everyone, I am Doctor Ritu Sharma. "
Module_22_Scaling_1,2100,4759,I am a faculty at National Law University Delhi. 
Module_22_Scaling_2,4759,9560,"Today I am going to talk about measurement and scaling technique, which is a part of "
Module_22_Scaling_3,9560,11631,Research Methodology module under MOOCS program. 
Module_22_Scaling_4,11631,17730,"MOOCS program as you know is one of the best method of e-learning, as it helps in the thorough "
Module_22_Scaling_5,17730,19010,understanding of the subject. 
Module_22_Scaling_6,19010,23610,"You can not only learn from the program, but also interact with the concern faculty via "
Module_22_Scaling_7,23610,26320,emails and chat rooms and get your doubts clear. 
Module_22_Scaling_8,26320,29470,Hope you are also finding it very beneficially. 
Module_22_Scaling_9,29470,34100,"Some, coming back to our subject, let’s talk about scaling and measurement. "
Module_22_Scaling_10,34100,39070,"So, first of all we are going to understand the meaning and definition of what the scaling "
Module_22_Scaling_11,39070,41420,and measurement technique is. 
Module_22_Scaling_12,41420,46420,Then we will be understanding the need of measurement and scaling technique and also 
Module_22_Scaling_13,46420,49290,when and where to use these techniques. 
Module_22_Scaling_14,49290,54200,While understanding scaling as a technique we will also understand various types of scales 
Module_22_Scaling_15,54200,60650,"with special reference to the rating and ranking order scale, which we often use in our research. "
Module_22_Scaling_16,60650,65170,Then we will be discussing the precautions and limitations of rating scales and finally 
Module_22_Scaling_17,65170,70479,we will discuss the various methods in rank order scales. 
Module_22_Scaling_18,70479,74760,"So, when, while talking about the measurement. "
Module_22_Scaling_19,74760,79140,"In our daily life, we only distinguish the characters and qualities of things and on "
Module_22_Scaling_20,79140,82400,the basis of this we reject or choose certain things. 
Module_22_Scaling_21,82400,87979,"In day today affairs, it is necessary to make judgements upon qualities which cannot ordinarily "
Module_22_Scaling_22,87979,90470,be differentiated from one another. 
Module_22_Scaling_23,90470,97130,"Propositions affirming qualitative differences are the first fruits of enquiry in any sciences, "
Module_22_Scaling_24,97130,102330,it is more necessary to know the magnitude of such difference precisely. 
Module_22_Scaling_25,102330,107710,This is required for the accuracy of statement and for discovering comprehensive principles 
Module_22_Scaling_26,107710,112870,on the basis of which the subject matter can be known to be systematically related. 
Module_22_Scaling_27,112870,118750,"So, if we can know the degree of qualitative difference, we can not only rule out re..., "
Module_22_Scaling_28,118750,125850,errors but can take up adequate measures to control the indicated changes as well if required. 
Module_22_Scaling_29,125850,131829,"In science, the accurate measurement of phenomena can give us great practical control over the "
Module_22_Scaling_30,131829,138469,studied subject and can make possible the formulation of principles of law which can 
Module_22_Scaling_31,138469,142279,make conformation or refutation unambiguous and clear. 
Module_22_Scaling_32,142279,148379,"So, quan… quantitative distinctions are substituted for qualitative ones, for theoretical "
Module_22_Scaling_33,148379,149750,and practical reasons. 
Module_22_Scaling_34,149750,156719,But many people without knowing the meaning and justification often use quantitative distinction. 
Module_22_Scaling_35,156719,162949,"For indicating the qualitative difference, the use of number requires a careful examination, "
Module_22_Scaling_36,162949,166819,if we are to avoid absurdity and errors. 
Module_22_Scaling_37,166819,172699,In order to deal with simple matters in our daily life and in sciences we need not resort 
Module_22_Scaling_38,172699,176919,to complicated methods of registering differences. 
Module_22_Scaling_39,176919,184110,"Measurement, calculation and the often difficult deduction of consequences from premises would "
Module_22_Scaling_40,184110,189159,not require the elaborate techniques which they in fact do require. 
Module_22_Scaling_41,189159,194279,But sometimes a more intricate technique than a bare common sense method is required for 
Module_22_Scaling_42,194279,197930,"formulating, collecting and estimating evidence. "
Module_22_Scaling_43,197930,203849,"Investigations cannot, perhaps, be properly and fru… fruitfully carried on without the "
Module_22_Scaling_44,203849,207169,introduction of quantitative methods. 
Module_22_Scaling_45,207169,212180,"Scientific methods, therefore, must study the foundation of applied mathematics. "
Module_22_Scaling_46,212180,215379,"Now, formal conditions of measurement. "
Module_22_Scaling_47,215379,220481,"For measuring the quality difference, the minimum requirement for employing numbers "
Module_22_Scaling_48,220481,224010,may be stated in the following first two conditions. 
Module_22_Scaling_49,224010,230939,"In a set of bodies, given A one, A two, till A n, one must with reference to a certain "
Module_22_Scaling_50,230939,236569,"quality be able to arrange them in such a way that between any two bodies, one and only "
Module_22_Scaling_51,236569,242239,"one of the following relations hold, A one is greater than A two. "
Module_22_Scaling_52,242239,247019,"A one and A two, third A one is equal to A two. "
Module_22_Scaling_53,247019,254430,"On the basis of the signs, less than or greater than, the qualitative difference in bodies can be studied. "
Module_22_Scaling_54,254430,258079,The relationship greater than must be asymmetrical. 
Module_22_Scaling_55,258079,265340,"Second, if A one is greater than A two and A two is greater than A three, then A one "
Module_22_Scaling_56,265340,270800,"is greater than A three, this is known as transitive condition. "
Module_22_Scaling_57,270800,276199,The above two conditions are sufficient for the measurement of intensive qualities. 
Module_22_Scaling_58,276199,279270,"Example, density, temperature, etcetera. "
Module_22_Scaling_59,279270,284430,"For the measurement of extensive qualities they are necessary, but not sufficient. "
Module_22_Scaling_60,284430,290120,Measurement of extensive qualities require some physical process of addition which should 
Module_22_Scaling_61,290120,292650,have the following formula. 
Module_22_Scaling_62,292650,299830,"If A one plus A two is equal to A three, then A two plus A one is equal to A three. "
Module_22_Scaling_63,299830,308139,"Second, if X is equal to Y, then X plus Z is greater than Y, where the value of Z is "
Module_22_Scaling_64,308139,309770,not zero or negative. 
Module_22_Scaling_65,309770,319710,"If A is equal to X, B is equal to Y, then A plus B is equal to X plus Y, A plus B plus "
Module_22_Scaling_66,319710,323419,C is equal to A plus B plus C. 
Module_22_Scaling_67,323419,330009,"If these conditions are satisfied measurement becomes possible, with the fulfilment of first "
Module_22_Scaling_68,330009,335159,two conditions it cannot be said that all the six conditions hold. 
Module_22_Scaling_69,335159,341750,"If the IQ of man is twice that of another, we only mean that the first man is higher "
Module_22_Scaling_70,341750,345530,than the other on a specific scale of preference. 
Module_22_Scaling_71,345530,352090,If it is absurd to say that the first has twice the intelligence or training because 
Module_22_Scaling_72,352090,358930,operation for adding intelligence or training has been found out which is consistent with 
Module_22_Scaling_73,358930,362350,the last four essential conditions. 
Module_22_Scaling_74,362350,367210,"Counting is another method which is also very helpful in measurement, counting is a method "
Module_22_Scaling_75,367210,369730,of judgement of enumeration. 
Module_22_Scaling_76,369730,375860,"In actual counting, classification and analyses are required and enumeration of instances "
Module_22_Scaling_77,375860,377879,is helpful for induction. 
Module_22_Scaling_78,377879,386470,"In order to more exactly enumerate the parts of which a whole is compose, we require weighing or measuring.  "
Module_22_Scaling_79,386470,390979,There is no essential difference between weighing and measuring. 
Module_22_Scaling_80,390979,396750,"In measurement, we make comparison, in measurement, we express the relation of the parts with "
Module_22_Scaling_81,396750,400080,the some common standard or units. 
Module_22_Scaling_82,400080,405789,"Through measurement the things are reduced to common terms, it is really the business "
Module_22_Scaling_83,405789,407870,of the physio-mathematical sciences. 
Module_22_Scaling_84,407870,416419,Counting and measuring helps us in achieving the exact body of knowledge which we call science. 
Module_22_Scaling_85,416419,420720,Counting gives us the exact knowledge and tries to avoid the vague ideas. 
Module_22_Scaling_86,420720,428150,"When we suspect significant connection between groups counted, counting is taken up. "
Module_22_Scaling_87,428150,434680,Counting makes our ideas precise and it helps in distinguishing various features of different groups. 
Module_22_Scaling_88,434680,438469,"However, only a discrete group can be counted. "
Module_22_Scaling_89,438469,444419,The number of individuals in a group represents an invariant property of the group from this 
Module_22_Scaling_90,444419,451430,arise the great importance of counting as a method of clarifying our ideas. 
Module_22_Scaling_91,451430,456300,Applied arithmetic is partly a collection of rules through which the invariant property 
Module_22_Scaling_92,456300,458460,can be easily discovered. 
Module_22_Scaling_93,458460,461900,Counting must be objective. 
Module_22_Scaling_94,461900,468340,"It is very difficult to count unless we know that what it is and we, that we are counting. "
Module_22_Scaling_95,468340,473860,"Where the difference between the groups is not distinct, the interpretation of the number "
Module_22_Scaling_96,473860,476349,obtained by counting is uncertain. 
Module_22_Scaling_97,476349,484120,"Thus, it is not easy to draw the line of a demarcation between skilled and unskilled workers. "
Module_22_Scaling_98,484120,489720,"In a social science research, the information which we get from the questionnaires is not "
Module_22_Scaling_99,489720,492900,"always reliable, clear or distinct. "
Module_22_Scaling_100,492900,497870,"The answer may also be affected by ignorance, dishonesty and vanity. "
Module_22_Scaling_101,497870,504650,"However, if the groups are very large in number or difficult to examine exhaustively, then "
Module_22_Scaling_102,504650,507270,enumeration is not under taken. 
Module_22_Scaling_103,507270,510779,"In such cases, sampling method is practised. "
Module_22_Scaling_104,510779,514120,Measurement of qualitative data. 
Module_22_Scaling_105,514120,518899,"In social sciences, we face problems which are subjective and qualitative. "
Module_22_Scaling_106,518899,522849,"For example, skills, values, attitude, utilities, etcetera. "
Module_22_Scaling_107,522849,529740,"Qualitative data cannot be quantitative or objectively measured, but qualitative data "
Module_22_Scaling_108,529740,534250,cease to be of much scientific value unless such datas are quantified. 
Module_22_Scaling_109,534250,541500,Professor Menegazzi pleaded for great attention to the qualitative aspect of social life to 
Module_22_Scaling_110,541500,545430,the synthetic or aggregative approach to the problem. 
Module_22_Scaling_111,545430,550790,It is to some extent possible to measure the intensive and extensive qualities. 
Module_22_Scaling_112,550790,557660,The qualitative data can be translated more or less satisfactorily to quantitative terms. 
Module_22_Scaling_113,557660,565240,"The technique of such translation has several steps, descriptions, categorization and determination "
Module_22_Scaling_114,565240,569110,of quantitative incidents and interrelations. 
Module_22_Scaling_115,569110,572519,These steps are generally known as “content analysis”. 
Module_22_Scaling_116,572519,578600,"About the content analysis you will be dealing in detail in a separate module, but just to "
Module_22_Scaling_117,578600,584420,"explain you the concept, we can go very briefly about the measurement of intensive qualities "
Module_22_Scaling_118,584420,585630,and extensive qualities. 
Module_22_Scaling_119,585630,593090,"There are some things like hardness, density, intelligence, etcetera which have non additive qualities. "
Module_22_Scaling_120,593090,598899,"These qualities are called intensive qualities, these qualities can be measured only in the "
Module_22_Scaling_121,598899,604089,sense that the different degrees of the quality may be arranged in a series. 
Module_22_Scaling_122,604089,609509,"In this case, questions regarding how much or how many times are meaningless. "
Module_22_Scaling_123,609509,612230,The qualities cannot be added. 
Module_22_Scaling_124,612230,620850,Characters of things cannot always be distinguish because they form a continuous series with one another.  
Module_22_Scaling_125,620850,626730,Sometime it is sufficient to know that one piece of wood is harder than the other one. 
Module_22_Scaling_126,626730,633110,But if we want to know how hard one piece of wood is as compared to the other piece. 
Module_22_Scaling_127,633110,641170,"Then we require very certain and uniform criteria, the varying degrees of qualities can be indicated "
Module_22_Scaling_128,641170,643060,be assigning different numbers. 
Module_22_Scaling_129,643060,651630,"For example, IQ of A is fifty and IQ of B is hundred, but in this way, we cannot get "
Module_22_Scaling_130,651630,656740,"the correct measurement, it should not be considered that measurement requires nothing "
Module_22_Scaling_131,656740,659520,more than the assigning of numbers. 
Module_22_Scaling_132,659520,665730,"But by assigning numbers, we can only indicate the degree of intensity that is which one "
Module_22_Scaling_133,665730,668839,is higher and which one is lower. 
Module_22_Scaling_134,668839,676040,"In the above example, it should not be interpreted that B is not possible in the case of an intensive "
Module_22_Scaling_135,676040,678019,quality by the assigned numbers. 
Module_22_Scaling_136,678019,681930,All qualities cannot be measured in the same senses. 
Module_22_Scaling_137,681930,687800,"Numbers have three uses to perform, one, as identification marks or tags. "
Module_22_Scaling_138,687800,694029,"Two, as signs to indicate the position of the degree of quality in a series of degrees. "
Module_22_Scaling_139,694029,698820,"Three, as a sign indicating qualitative relationship between different qualities. "
Module_22_Scaling_140,698820,705639,"Talking about the first, sometimes number can be used to indicate names or identity. "
Module_22_Scaling_141,705639,709830,"Example, convict number hundred, convict number two hundred, etcetera. "
Module_22_Scaling_142,709830,715100,Numbers are more convenient than verbal names for various reason. 
Module_22_Scaling_143,715100,719910,But the assigning of the numbers does not indicate any relationship between the object 
Module_22_Scaling_144,719910,725170,number co… corresponding to the numerical relationship between the assigned numbers. 
Module_22_Scaling_145,725170,731779,"Thus, convict number hundred is not twice as criminal as convict number fifty. "
Module_22_Scaling_146,731779,738160,"And talking about the second point, a scientifically more important use of number is when the order "
Module_22_Scaling_147,738160,744560,"of number, numerical magnitude is the same as the order of the position of the character "
Module_22_Scaling_148,744560,748550,studied in a scale of or ladder of qualities. 
Module_22_Scaling_149,748550,752180,Intensive quality can be arranged as a relation property. 
Module_22_Scaling_150,752180,760449,"For example, if any, if by experiment, we can show that diamond is harder than glass "
Module_22_Scaling_151,760449,767089,"and glass is harder than pinewood, then we can show that diamond is harder than pinewood. "
Module_22_Scaling_152,767089,773360,"Here, relationship properly is said to be asymmetrical, if A one is harder than A two, "
Module_22_Scaling_153,773360,776639,but A two is not harder than A one. 
Module_22_Scaling_154,776639,782009,"By arranging the bodies in a line, linear series, according to quality, we can get a "
Module_22_Scaling_155,782009,785420,scale or ladder of this quality. 
Module_22_Scaling_156,785420,791290,If the relation of magnitude of numbers is asymmetrical and done in the preparation of 
Module_22_Scaling_157,791290,795079,"the index numbers, this will increase the validity of the scale. "
Module_22_Scaling_158,795079,801720,"However, in social qualitative measurement, absolute reliability and perfect validity "
Module_22_Scaling_159,801720,803600,should not be expected. 
Module_22_Scaling_160,803600,807310,There are some other requirements of measurement. 
Module_22_Scaling_161,807310,813750,"For effective measurement, the unit of enumeration must be determined, either a single respondent "
Module_22_Scaling_162,813750,818790,or a part of the content may be taken as the unit of enumeration. 
Module_22_Scaling_163,818790,826490,"It is better to have the same system of categories, same units of enumeration and the same operational "
Module_22_Scaling_164,826490,832820,definitions in order to know quantitatively the degree of deviation it is very necessary 
Module_22_Scaling_165,832820,835560,to have certain norms. 
Module_22_Scaling_166,835560,841160,The tools of measurement of qualitative data can be applied if the following steps are 
Module_22_Scaling_167,841160,842459,taken into consideration. 
Module_22_Scaling_168,842459,849629,"First, this, the data should be specified and a matrix should be developed within attitude "
Module_22_Scaling_169,849629,851199,scale and scoring devices. 
Module_22_Scaling_170,851199,854519,"Second, the coded data should be properly tabulated. "
Module_22_Scaling_171,854519,862470,"Third, a list of variables in terms of which the content is to be cod… coded, coded should be prepared. "
Module_22_Scaling_172,862470,866509,"Forth, the categories of each variable should be filled in. "
Module_22_Scaling_173,866509,871769,The categories should not be either too broad or too narrow. 
Module_22_Scaling_174,871769,875620,"Fifth, proper definitions and procedures should be used. "
Module_22_Scaling_175,875620,881319,"Sixth, the outline of the analysis maybe prepared in the fashion of a pilot survey. "
Module_22_Scaling_176,881319,887779,The success of a measurement depends on the theoretical procedure and on the codes. 
Module_22_Scaling_177,887779,894029,"The method of measurement should be as far as possible, accurate, and the coders must "
Module_22_Scaling_178,894029,898970,"be neutral, alert, trained and painstaking. "
Module_22_Scaling_179,898970,904879,"Now, as we have understood the concept of measurement and what is to be kept in mind "
Module_22_Scaling_180,904879,908600,while measuring intensive and extensive da… data. 
Module_22_Scaling_181,908600,911639,We need to understand scaling now. 
Module_22_Scaling_182,911639,918500,"So, let's now understand the concept of scaling because to measure anything we need scaling. "
Module_22_Scaling_183,918500,924200,"In social research, it is very essential to make distinction of degree rather than quality. "
Module_22_Scaling_184,924200,928449,The technique of registering difference in degree may be of two type. 
Module_22_Scaling_185,928449,934019,"Firstly, one can make a judgement about some characteristics of an individual and place "
Module_22_Scaling_186,934019,938829,"him on a scale which is meant for measuring the charac..., that characteristic. "
Module_22_Scaling_187,938829,945770,"A scale is a continuum from highest to lowest point, and has intermediate points in between "
Module_22_Scaling_188,945770,947690,these two extremes. 
Module_22_Scaling_189,947690,953509,The techniques may consist of questionnaire prepared in such a fashion that the score 
Module_22_Scaling_190,953509,958130,of individual’s response give him a particular place on the scale. 
Module_22_Scaling_191,958130,961120,A scale is a method of measurement. 
Module_22_Scaling_192,961120,966329,"In social research, attitude, behaviour and other qualitative characteristics are measured "
Module_22_Scaling_193,966329,969010,by means of different scales. 
Module_22_Scaling_194,969010,972850,The scalability of a phenomenon depends on its continuum. 
Module_22_Scaling_195,972850,979759,The various factors of the phenomenon must be logically interrelated and should be capable 
Module_22_Scaling_196,979759,980810,of continued measurement. 
Module_22_Scaling_197,980810,984160,A scale must be reliable. 
Module_22_Scaling_198,984160,989209,The following methods that we have already discussed in our module on reliability and 
Module_22_Scaling_199,989209,993639,validity can be used to test the reliability of a scale. 
Module_22_Scaling_200,993639,1000070,"Like, first is retest method - According to this method the same scale is applied twice "
Module_22_Scaling_201,1000070,1006560,"to the same population for the same objective and if the two re… results are similar, "
Module_22_Scaling_202,1006560,1009079,the scale is regarded as reliable. 
Module_22_Scaling_203,1009079,1013750,"For this matter, the test can be done on two similar groups also. "
Module_22_Scaling_204,1013750,1019500,Second is multiple forms - According to this technique two types of scales are constructed 
Module_22_Scaling_205,1019500,1021449,and they are applied to the same population. 
Module_22_Scaling_206,1021449,1027570,"In case the two results are more or less similar, the scales maybe regarded as reliable. "
Module_22_Scaling_207,1027570,1035350,"Third is split half method - In this method, the scale may be divided into two equal parts. "
Module_22_Scaling_208,1035350,1043200,"The, then each part is taken as a whole that is as a complete scale and measurement is made separately. "
Module_22_Scaling_209,1043200,1049390,The correlation between the two scores obtained this way is estimated and the degree of correlation 
Module_22_Scaling_210,1049390,1053540,"is high, the scale may be regarded as reliable. "
Module_22_Scaling_211,1053540,1058230,"In a scale, proper weightage should be given to the various points provided the various "
Module_22_Scaling_212,1058230,1061800,items are disproportionate or unequal. 
Module_22_Scaling_213,1061800,1067160,"However, a scale must be valid, that is it should correctly measure things. "
Module_22_Scaling_214,1067160,1072400,There are at least four different cri… criterias of measuring validity. 
Module_22_Scaling_215,1072400,1078680,First is logical validity - The scale must confirm to the common sense reasoning and 
Module_22_Scaling_216,1078680,1085130,"therefore is a partly subjective, but still in some very clear cases this crude method "
Module_22_Scaling_217,1085130,1087030,may be helpful. 
Module_22_Scaling_218,1087030,1091770,"Second is unknown groups - In this method, the scale is applied to the known category "
Module_22_Scaling_219,1091770,1096570,"of people, then the result obtained is compared with the known facts. "
Module_22_Scaling_220,1096570,1100130,If they are similar the scale is considered to be valid. 
Module_22_Scaling_221,1100130,1106390,"Third, opinion of Jury - This method depends on the considered opinion of many Juries, "
Module_22_Scaling_222,1106390,1108670,who will have no bias. 
Module_22_Scaling_223,1108670,1115270,"If several Juries give the same opinion, the method of measurement may be considered as valid. "
Module_22_Scaling_224,1115270,1122200,"Fourth, independent method - A thing maybe separately measured separately with the separate "
Module_22_Scaling_225,1122200,1128110,"independent criteria and if the result are similar, the scale may be said to be valid. "
Module_22_Scaling_226,1128110,1134500,"However, these methods of testing and validity of a scale are not free from flaws, thus, "
Module_22_Scaling_227,1134500,1138640,"they have the, to be used very cautiously. "
Module_22_Scaling_228,1138640,1143620,The scaling method is used when the researcher wishes to utilise simultaneously a number 
Module_22_Scaling_229,1143620,1145720,of observation on a respondent. 
Module_22_Scaling_230,1145720,1150760,A number of difficulties maybe encountered by the researcher in arranging the meaningful 
Module_22_Scaling_231,1150760,1156370,responses logically and incorporating the responses in the analysis of attitude. 
Module_22_Scaling_232,1156370,1162710,"Re… reasonable reliability is one attribute required for a scale, validity is another, "
Module_22_Scaling_233,1162710,1168230,"but they are related matters, it is very difficult to objectively interpret validity. "
Module_22_Scaling_234,1168230,1174260,"Where a scale is developed on the basis of objective criteria, the validity can be judged "
Module_22_Scaling_235,1174260,1176810,by testing the criteria itself. 
Module_22_Scaling_236,1176810,1181900,The validity maybe for the future that is predictive validity or for the present that 
Module_22_Scaling_237,1181900,1183370,is concurrent validity. 
Module_22_Scaling_238,1183370,1189150,"So, there is need for the scaling technique and the, when and where to use. "
Module_22_Scaling_239,1189150,1194800,The difficulty of applying rigorous and objective test in attitude measurement arises from the 
Module_22_Scaling_240,1194800,1201830,fact that such measurement is indirect for attitude is inferred from verbal responses. 
Module_22_Scaling_241,1201830,1210500,An attitude is an abstraction and as such it is almost impossible to assess its validity directly. 
Module_22_Scaling_242,1210500,1216800,"A scale is applicable to a particular group or class, it is not universally applicable. "
Module_22_Scaling_243,1216800,1220490,Human behaviour is heterogeneous and unpredictable. 
Module_22_Scaling_244,1220490,1225180,Social phenomena are complex and qualitative in nature. 
Module_22_Scaling_245,1225180,1233070,"The concepts themselves are not defined properly, thus qua… quantitative measurement is a baffling affair. "
Module_22_Scaling_246,1233070,1237420,There is no universally valid or recognized measuring rod. 
Module_22_Scaling_247,1237420,1239600,This measuring unit itself may be variable. 
Module_22_Scaling_248,1239600,1246820,"A valid scale in the ultimate analysis is also a subjective consideration, but the most "
Module_22_Scaling_249,1246820,1250150,baffling problem is the criteria of validity. 
Module_22_Scaling_250,1250150,1254080,Human behaviour is fle… flexible and variable. 
Module_22_Scaling_251,1254080,1260450,"Whatever attitude is expressed at a point of time may not be taken as a reliable, even "
Module_22_Scaling_252,1260450,1264170,a valid scale may not remain valid during the period of analysis. 
Module_22_Scaling_253,1264170,1270590,"There is often a dichotomy between the express, expressed attitude and overt action. "
Module_22_Scaling_254,1270590,1277340,The intelligibility of social phenomena is an obstacle to scale construction. 
Module_22_Scaling_255,1277340,1283500,The scores of the scale cannot be correctly tested because of the intangi… intangibility 
Module_22_Scaling_256,1283500,1285520,of the social phenomena. 
Module_22_Scaling_257,1285520,1289640,The social phenomena cannot be experimental in a controlled way. 
Module_22_Scaling_258,1289640,1293830,"The phenomena may be individual, private or esoteric. "
Module_22_Scaling_259,1293830,1298230,"Therefore, they cannot be properly washed and evaluated. "
Module_22_Scaling_260,1298230,1304820,"Thus, scale cannot measure all the causative variables involved. "
Module_22_Scaling_261,1304820,1311290,"Despite these limitations, the scaling technique can be improved to measure the social phenomena "
Module_22_Scaling_262,1311290,1313380,more or less accurately. 
Module_22_Scaling_263,1313380,1318610,The sociometric type of analysis is a case in point. 
Module_22_Scaling_264,1318610,1321860,"Chi..., let's now understand the different types of scales. "
Module_22_Scaling_265,1321860,1328400,"There are the following four main types of scales- nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales. "
Module_22_Scaling_266,1328400,1332660,"We will be discussing each of it, it in detail. "
Module_22_Scaling_267,1332660,1338740,A nominal scale - A nominal scale consists of two or more named category into which individual 
Module_22_Scaling_268,1338740,1341500,objects or responses are classified. 
Module_22_Scaling_269,1341500,1348430,"In a nominal scale, it is possible to distinguish two or more categories relating to the specified attributes. "
Module_22_Scaling_270,1348430,1355310,The members of these categories differ with respect to the specified attribute which is the measure. 
Module_22_Scaling_271,1355310,1359270,It is a simple method of classification rather than arrangement along a continuum. 
Module_22_Scaling_272,1359270,1365200,The question of dimensions is not important in this type of scale. 
Module_22_Scaling_273,1365200,1370760,"If desired, the difference, different groups maybe numbered. "
Module_22_Scaling_274,1370760,1375660,Classification of individual according to religion is an example of nominal scale. 
Module_22_Scaling_275,1375660,1381620,"Then comes the Ordinal Scale - In this type of scale numbers, example one, two, three, "
Module_22_Scaling_276,1381620,1386840,etcetera are assigned to indicate the only the relative position. 
Module_22_Scaling_277,1386840,1393340,"The scale purpose is to give ranks to the individual along the specified continuum, "
Module_22_Scaling_278,1393340,1400070,but such a scale like the nominal scale does not measure the distance between the positions. 
Module_22_Scaling_279,1400070,1406360,"In this scale, it is very essential to determine the order of position in terms of more or "
Module_22_Scaling_280,1406360,1412590,"less, better or worse and so on in relation to the attribute which is being measured. "
Module_22_Scaling_281,1412590,1416880,"For instance, X is regarded as more beautiful than Y. "
Module_22_Scaling_282,1416880,1424000,"The ordinal scale can indicate only a person’s relative position, but it cannot cardinally "
Module_22_Scaling_283,1424000,1426920,measure the difference between the persons. 
Module_22_Scaling_284,1426920,1433100,"One can say, for example, X is greater than Y, but he cannot say by how much. "
Module_22_Scaling_285,1433100,1438930,Third is Interval or Cardinal Scale - This scale has equal units of measurement. 
Module_22_Scaling_286,1438930,1446100,"Thus, it is possible to interpret not only the order of scale scores but also the distance between them. "
Module_22_Scaling_287,1446100,1453580,"Thus, two persons with scale position four and five are as far apart as two person with "
Module_22_Scaling_288,1453580,1455670,scale position of ten and eleven. 
Module_22_Scaling_289,1455670,1461660,A person having the score of ten cannot be regarded as two times higher or better than 
Module_22_Scaling_290,1461660,1464060,a person whose score is five. 
Module_22_Scaling_291,1464060,1470350,"When we talk of ten degree Celsius rise in temperature, it does not mean that it is twice "
Module_22_Scaling_292,1470350,1473060,as hot as five degree Celsius. 
Module_22_Scaling_293,1473060,1477380,"In an Interval scale, the intervals remains the equal. "
Module_22_Scaling_294,1477380,1483240,Then comes the Ratio Scale - This scale incorporates the properties of an interval scale together 
Module_22_Scaling_295,1483240,1486810,with the fixed origin or zero point. 
Module_22_Scaling_296,1486810,1491680,"Weight, length and time are obvious example of ratio scales. "
Module_22_Scaling_297,1491680,1497270,"On the basis of ratio scale, one can compare both difference in scores and the relative "
Module_22_Scaling_298,1497270,1498450,magnitude of score. 
Module_22_Scaling_299,1498450,1503140,"For instance, the difference between ten and fifteen minutes is the same as the difference "
Module_22_Scaling_300,1503140,1510050,between fifteen and twenty minutes and ten minutes is twice as long as five minutes. 
Module_22_Scaling_301,1510050,1516180,"Then comes the Rating Scale - Another important type of scale which is, which is often used "
Module_22_Scaling_302,1516180,1517770,in everyday life. 
Module_22_Scaling_303,1517770,1523650,"The rating, ranking and attitude scales have one common method of assigning numerical position "
Module_22_Scaling_304,1523650,1527160,"to individual, so that variation in degree may be asserted. "
Module_22_Scaling_305,1527160,1533980,"While preparing a rating scale, the rater places the individual at a particular point "
Module_22_Scaling_306,1533980,1538620,along a continuum and a numerical value is attached to this point. 
Module_22_Scaling_307,1538620,1543010,The following are the main types of rating scales used in research. 
Module_22_Scaling_308,1543010,1548820,First is Graphic Rating Scale - This is most common used rating scale. 
Module_22_Scaling_309,1548820,1555820,"Under this method, the rater indicates his rating by putting a tick at the point selected "
Module_22_Scaling_310,1555820,1564140,by him on the line chosen or measuring an attribute any specific point from lowest to the highest. 
Module_22_Scaling_311,1564140,1569190,The different scale point may indicate brief descri… descriptions about attitude level. 
Module_22_Scaling_312,1569190,1572370,This may help the rater to indicate his own preferences. 
Module_22_Scaling_313,1572370,1575510,The following is the example of a graphic rating scale. 
Module_22_Scaling_314,1575510,1581690,"We can, from one to five we can place it like this, one means he feels strongly for the "
Module_22_Scaling_315,1581690,1583080,students management. 
Module_22_Scaling_316,1583080,1589770,"Two means generally feels the necessity for participation, three means part, partly favours "
Module_22_Scaling_317,1589770,1591570,or partly disfavours. 
Module_22_Scaling_318,1591570,1597770,"Forth means generally feels no necessity of participation, five means feels no necessity "
Module_22_Scaling_319,1597770,1599800,of participation at all. 
Module_22_Scaling_320,1599800,1608530,The rater may mark anyone of five points to indicate his own rating and thereby may reveal his preferences. 
Module_22_Scaling_321,1608530,1614150,"The graphic rating scale is a very simple and convenient device to use, it ensures a "
Module_22_Scaling_322,1614150,1617800,fair level of fineness of scoring. 
Module_22_Scaling_323,1617800,1622880,"In the rating scale, vague, unlikely and extreme statement should be avoided. "
Module_22_Scaling_324,1622880,1628640,"Secondly, as far as possible the description statement should closely correspond to the "
Module_22_Scaling_325,1628640,1631390,numerical points on the scale. 
Module_22_Scaling_326,1631390,1638250,Then it is the Itemized Rating Scale - Itemized Rating Scale is also known as specific category 
Module_22_Scaling_327,1638250,1640470,scale or numerical scale. 
Module_22_Scaling_328,1640470,1645920,"In this scale, the rater has to select one of the limited number of categories that are "
Module_22_Scaling_329,1645920,1648880,in order in terms of their scale position. 
Module_22_Scaling_330,1648880,1652540,"Generally, in such a scale, there are five or seven categories. "
Module_22_Scaling_331,1652540,1659880,"Barker, Dembo and Lewin prepared a seven point scale for rating constructiveness among children. "
Module_22_Scaling_332,1659880,1667600,"As a general rule, the more clear defined the categories, the more reliable becomes the rating. "
Module_22_Scaling_333,1667600,1670630,"The number of sepc… specification, however, depends on the nature of the research problem. "
